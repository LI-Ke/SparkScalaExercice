The contribution of L. C. Gray to the economic theory of exhaustible natural resources and its roots in the history of economic thought	Journal of Environmental Economics and Management	1983	01	01	"The paper opens with an assessment of natural resources economics up to 1913-14 when Gray published his two pioneering articles in natural resources economics (Part I). An in-depth study of Gray, weighing his contribution to the microeconomic theory of the mine and the macroeconomic theory of conservation against current literature, constitutes the main body of the paper (Part II). Gray and Hotelling's contributions to the theory of the mine are compared (Part III). The paper concludes with a comparison drawn between the author's findings and the scant attention previously paid to Gray's contributions to natural resources economics. ""So far as I know, this is the first attempt to apply economic theory to this particular problem of conservation."" (H. C. Taylor, unpublished letter to C. R. Van Hise, May 23, 1913, a reference to Gray's ""Economic Possibilities of Conservation"")."	Philippe J Crabb√©
Integration of resource economics and ecology	Ecological Modelling	1987	01	01	Economic activities that use natural resources are contained by ecological properties. Resource policy making thus has to include ecological considerations next to the economic assessments. Five overlapping options to achieve this goal are reviewed and discussed: 'stretching' concepts and methods, bioeconomics, compartment models, the systems framework approach, and a general resource policy analysis. 'Stretching' concepts is considered elegant but not very effective. Bioeconomics does not fully acknowledge ecological systems. Compartment models gain more attention nowadays but face size and integration problems. Systems approaches (holistic models) face the bias of reduction to a single denominator, and are often costly. The same goes for general policy analysis, which nevertheless may be most effective.	S.W.F. Van der Ploeg, L.C. Braat, W.F.J. Van Lierop

The case for methodological pluralism	Ecological Economics	1989	01	01	"Ecology and economics share the same Greek root. Both address complex systems. Ecology consists of numerous approaches to understanding natural systems: energetics, population biology, food-web models, hierarchy theory to mention just a few. Within ecology, field knowledge and the reporting of new observations are well respected. Economics, on the other hand, is dominated by one pattern of thinking and standard of ""proof"", the market model and econometrics. Within economics, field knowledge and observations per se are little valued. Agreement on a correct method is frequently taken as an indication of the maturity of a science. The argument is developed in this paper that all the aspects of complex systems can only be understood through multiple methodologies. The agreement on method within economics, however, seems to reflect stronger pressures within the discipline for conformity than for truth relative to ecology. Since ecological economics seeks to understand a larger system than either economics or ecology seeks to understand, a diversity of methodologies is appropriate and pressures to eliminate methodologies for the sake of conformity should be avoided."

Ecological economics: Rationale and problem areas	Ecological Economics	1989	01	01	"This paper is concerned with the nature of ecological economics as an area of interdisciplinary study and with problem areas which need to be confronted. After reviewing some of the perceived aims of work in this area, some of the sources of stimulus for studying ecological economics are considered. The roles of theories of history and ""utopias"" for ecological economics are assessed. The notion of ""paradigmatic images of the world"" is then introduced and related to utopias and the way that these influence work in ecological economics. Finally, a series of practical, ethical and conceptual problem areas are outlined, which require further interdisciplinary study."	John L.R. Proops

Okoboji experiment: Comparing non-market valuation techniques in an unusually well-defined market for water quality	Ecological Economics	1989	01	01	Three techniques to value the non-market commodity of water quality are compared in a notably active and unusually well-defined market: the Okoboji Lakes region of northwest Iowa. The paper compares: (a) a site valuation based on differing property values across lakes; (b) a market valuation by soliciting realtors' interpretations of observed price differentials; and (c) a contingent valuation of willingness to pay for water quality changes. The results obtained are similar in magnitude; the value of water quality ranges from 13 to 23% of the total residence value per square foot of private residence.	Ralph C. d'Arge, Jason F. Shogren

Environmental bonds and environmental research in innovative activities	Ecological Economics	1989	01	01	"This paper considers the incentive to uncover potential future social costs of activities having no historical precedents. Since ex ante markets in the future external effects of historically unique activities are non-existent, the private incentives to uncover the possibility of ""Thalidomide-type"" results in such activities is weak. The paper discusses the value of sequentially determined environmental bonds as mechanisms for the generation of research funds in these cases, and derives measures for the calculation of such bonds."

Economic sustainability and the preservation of environmental assets	Environmental Management	1990	01	01	Abstract: The core requirement of sustainability is that current economic activities should not result in an excessive burden on future generations. This criterion is general enough to imply different decision rules for the preservation of environmental assets. Neoclassical economics does not have a sustainability criterion for environmental assets independent of the intertemporal efficiency criterion, which allocates environmental and man-made capital based on projected monetary benefits and costs. This criterion is examined in terms of the feasibility of valuing the benefits of environmental assets, the substitution possibilities between natural and man-made capital, and the ethical grounds for using efficiency as the sole determinant of the allocation of environmental assets. An alternative ecological sustainability criterion is the preservation of safe minimum levels of environmental assets in physical terms rather than the dollar value of a composite of natural and man-made capital. Safe minimum standards for environmental assets constrain the efficiency criterion in order to ensure the sustainability of economic systems. It is argued that the ecological approach to sustainability should limit the economic approach for decisions involving the allocation of environmental assets.	George Foy

Thinking economically about climate change	Energy Policy	1990	01	01	Uncertainty over both the regional impacts and timing of climatic changes, the way they tend to magnify the likelihood of so-called 'natural' disasters and their irreversibility, require careful analysis of policy options. From an economic standpoint, the best approach is to apply 'cost-benefit thinking'. The essential trade-off is between doing nothing now and investing in either important preventive or adaptive measures. The choices involve analysis of incurring costs now against the benefits of reducing vulnerability and future damage costs. For any given level of warming, the aim is to minimize the sum of policy costs and costs of adaptation by individuals. Any resulting policy decision will have to address issues of international cooperation and compensation. These considerations may in turn influence the resulting policy choices between 'carbon' taxes, marketable permits and regulatory restrictions.	Edward B. Barbier, David W. Pearce
Public choice and the improvement of policy instruments for environmental management	Ecological Economics	1990	01	01	Currently used policy instruments have failed to halt environmental deterioration of sensitive ecological systems, such as estuaries. On the basis of efficiency criteria, economists have made comprehensive recommendations for improving policy instruments. The general rejection of efficiency-based policy instruments indicates the need for a broader set of criteria for improving environmental management. This paper suggests a public choice approach to environmental management, under which the design of more effective policy instruments would be based not only upon economic efficiency but also upon scientific validity (including ecological sustainability), distributional equity, and interest group acceptability. Examples are given for the Chesapeake Bay.	John H. Cumberland
Entropy, environment and resources: An essay in physio-economics	Ecological Economics	1990	01	01		Martin O'Connor
Alternative approaches to economic-environmental interactions	Ecological Economics	1990	01	01	The key questions raised by recent developments in resource and environmental economics have been what useful economic functions does the environment provide and how are these functions affected by the process of economic-environmental interaction? This paper distinguishes between two different formal approaches to answering these questions: the more conventional approach which is concerned with the optimal allocation of economically valuable exhaustible resources and an alternative analysis that considers the trade-off between, on the one hand, environmental quality, and on the other, resource depletion and waste generation by the economic process. To illustrate and extend the latter approach, a model is constructed to show how this trade-off might lead to continuously declining environmental quality and a future ecological constraint. Society must therefore optimally allocate output between consumption and services to improve the environment and choose between increased capital accumulation and environmental degradation. Although strict application of such a model may be limited, it has wider implications for the role of technological change and the value of the environment in any system experiencing deteriorating environmental quality	Edward B. Barbier

Economics of sustainability or the sustainability of economics: Different paradigms	Ecological Economics	1991	01	01	This article reviews different views of neo-classical and ecological economics on the sustainability of economic growth and welfare. Neo-classical economics concludes that, due to substitution and technical progress, consumption can be sustained even if production depends on a natural resource that is being depleted. If production depends on an essential, renewable resource, there is a level of consumption that can be sustained forever. Pollution lowers the level of consumption that can be sustained. If production depends on an exhaustible resource, recycling of waste is insufficient for sustaining consumption unless 100% recycling is possible. Sustainable economic development is possible if the resource growth potential exceeds the sum of the discount rate minus the rate of exogenous technical progress and if resource productivity is sufficiently high. In addition, intial levels of environmental quality (a composite of pollution and natural resources) and man-made capital influence the possibilities for sustainable economic development. If the resource stock itself affects utility, or if irreversibilities occur, optimal consumption and extraction are lowered. Ecological economics states that: substitution possibilities are restricted, full recycling of waste is impossible, and the limited influx of solar energy poses an additional constraint on the level of production that can be sustained. Since the functions of the environment (production factor, consumer good and waste sink) are intertwined, this life support function poses a restriction on economic growth as well. In ecological economics development is viewed as an evolutionary process with continuous feedbacks between a changing economy and environment. Welfare is not merely the sum of discounted individual preferences but requires environmental compatibility and the explicit (collective) formulation of policies regarding the conservation of species, ecosystems and natural resources.

Entropy, structure, and organisational change	Ecological Economics	1991	01	01	"The paper sets out a basis for rigorous thermodynamic characterisation of structural change and of organisational interdependencies between economic and environmental processes. Many attempts have been made to exploit entropy as a generic explanatory variable. It has widely been proposed that entropy is a measure of the level of (dis)order of a system, of how 'mixed up' things are. Then, as organisation is often thought synonymous with some notion of 'order', it has been a small step to propose that 'increasing organisation' is the converse of 'increasing entropy'. Another suggestion has been that social system structure and change can be explained in terms of a tendency towards maximum entropy production (the Lotka Principle of maximum energy dissipation). All these notions must be rejected. The putative entropy-order connection has its inspiration in Boltzmann's probabilistic interpretation of thermodynamic entropy as a measure of microscopic 'disorder'. This 'order principle' is simply not applicable under conditions ""far from thermodynamic equilibrium"" (Prigogine), conditions which prevail for all important economic and ecological processes. Under such conditions the relationship between entropy production and changes in structure or organisation is multi-faceted and situation-specific. Attempts to account for the specificity of societal activities in terms of a generic scalar measure of organisation or dissipation, are largely after-the fact, and in no way do away with the need for analysis of institutional and ethical dimensions of human action in their own right. When properly allied to institutional analysis, however, the far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics furnishes a rich impetus for a 'coevolutionary' perspective in ecological economics, with promise of incisive treatments of, in particular, issues of system-environment codependency and of the time-in- determinacies of economy-environmental change."

Bioeconomics and post Keynesian economics: a search for common ground	Ecological Economics	1991	01	01	This paper is concerned with the links between two schools of economic thought which challenge the neoclassical synthesis. Bioeconomics refers to that school of economics stressing the fact that the human species is a part of the larger biosystem of the planet and ultimately subject to the same laws and limitations as other life forms. Post Keynesian economics is a specific school of macroeconomics stressing the fundamental ideas of Keynes, Marx, and Kalecki concerning uncertainty, the nature of production, and the role of government in economic affairs. Bioeconomics and post Keynesian economics have much in common in terms of their methodological framework, their emphasis on production rather than exchange, and their interpretation of the social rate of discount. A potential area of conflict between the two schools is their attitude toward economic growth. The areas of commonality between the two schools are discussed and a research and policy program which combines the insights of both approaches is suggested.	John M. Gowdy

An idiosyncratic assessment of the role of mathematical models in environmental sciences	Environment International	1991	01	01	This paper summarizes a number of studies in two disciplines of particular interest to environmental scientists and managers: academic ecology and academic economics. These studies suggest that too often in the past we have been extremely cavalier in our acceptance and use of some theoretical mathematical models purporting great importance and generality. Of particular concern is that on a number of occasions, data have been presented as substantiation of certain theoretical models while in fact, on closer examination, they are not. In many cases, the use of these formulations have led to unnecessary environmental destruction and illogical economic decisions. I conclude that, although there are many good reasons to continue to formalize our knowledge about systems through explicit model development, we must not continue to confuse mathematical rigor with scientific rigor, and we must subject our theoretical formulations to more rigid tests vis-a-vis nature than we have in the past.

Environmental management in development: the evolution of paradigms	Ecological Economics	1991	01	01	Environmental management and its relationship to human development are in a period of dramatic change. Societies are now beginning to have serious discussions about 'sustainable development', but there is still a great deal of confusion over what this means and how to achieve it. Conceptions of what is economically and technologically practical, ecologically necessary, and politically feasible are rapidly shifting. Implicit in changing strategies are differing philosophies of human-nature relationships. Five fundamental paradigms of environmental management in development, of human-nature relationships, are described. From the primordial dichotomy of 'frontier economics' versus 'deep ecology', paradigms of 'environmental protection', 'resource management', and 'eco-development' are evolving, in a progression which involves increasing integration of economic, ecological, and social systems into the definition of development and the organization of human societies. Each perceives different evidence, imperatives, and problems, and prescribes different solutions, strategies, technologies, roles for economic sectors, culture, governments, and ethics, etc. Each actually encompasses several schools of thought, not always in complete agreement, and there are also areas of overlap. The paper explores the distinctions, connections, and implications of these five paradigms for the future of environmental management in development.	Michael E. Colby

Ecological economics: A research agenda	Structural Change and Economic Dynamics	1991	01	01	Ecological economics is a new transdisciplinary approach that looks at the full range of inter-relationships between ecological and economic systems. This breadth is essential if we are to understand and manage our planet wisely in the face of mounting interdependent global environmental, population, and economic development problems. This paper summarizes the state and goals of this emerging transdisciplinary field, particularly as regards issues of sustainability, and provides a working agenda for research. Assuring sustainability of ecological economic systems depends on our ability to make local and short-term goals and incentives (like local economic growth and private interests) consistent with global and long-term goals (like sustainability and global welfare). This requires: (1) establishing a hierarchy of goals for local, national, and global ecological economic planning and management; (2) developing better regional and global ecological economic modelling capabilities to allow us to see the range of possible outcomes of our current activities; (3) adjusting prices and other local incentives to reflect long run, global ecological costs, including uncertainty; and (4) developing policies that lead to no further decline in the stock of natural capital.

Ecological sustainability and environmental control	Structural Change and Economic Dynamics	1991	01	01	The concept of ecological sustainability requires that at least some stocks of environmental assets be prevented from rising above or falling below certain threshold levels. This paper considers the implications of this requirement in the context of a general model of environmental control, paying particular attention to the informational and structural conditions that are necessary and sufficient to satisfy the requirement. These conditions turn out to be particularly stringent, and will not ordinarily be satisfied. The paper then considers the scope for achieving the goal of ecological sustainability when the system is not controllable through economic incentives, implying that prices are inadequate observers of environmental processes. It argues the merits of a policy of environmental stabilization based on direct observation of the physical system, in which ecological sustainability is assured through the imposition of physical restrictions on economic activity so as to avoid breaching the critical thresholds. Since the price assumptions of the model are very weak, the results are robust with respect to a range of economic theories of price.	Charles Perrings

Valuing environmental resources under alternative management regimes	Ecological Economics	1991	01	01	This paper shows that the economic values of resources depend in part on the management regime. The value of a resource supporting a commercial fishery will depend on whether the fishery is optimally managed or open access. The Ellis-Fisher (1987) data are used to calculate values under alternative assumptions about management. These calculations show that value is influenced not only by biological and economic factors, but also by institutions.	A.Myrick Freeman,  III

Regulating the electricity supply industry by valuing environmental effects	Futures	1992	01	01	All approaches to the comparison of disparate environmental effects suffer in common from several intractable problems. Difficulties are posed by the obscurity, complexity, uncertainty and unquantifiability of many effects. Incommensurate indices and discrepant frames of reference exacerbate the analyst's predicament. Although increasingly influential, the monetary valuation literature tends to neglect these problems. Important recent valuation studies are found to be partial in scope, mutually inconsistent and misleadingly presented. The theoretical framework of valuation is itself argued to be profoundly flawed, being unidimensional, sociocentric and opaque in character. It is concluded that there exist preferable and more effective analytical options.	Andrew Stirling

Towards an ecological economics of sustainability	Ecological Economics	1992	01	01	Persistent disagreement both as to the interpretation to be given to sustainability, and as to the relation between ecological and economic sustainability, has hindered the development of an ecological economics of sustainable resource use. This paper identifies the main concepts of sustainability deriving from the two disciplines in order to explore the difference implied by an ecological approach to the problem. It is argued that present economic and ecological approaches are largely disjoint, and that they address basically different phenomena. By combining the efficiency requirements of what is usually thought of as economic sustainability with the stability requirements of an ecological approach, it is shown that an intertemporally efficient allocation of resources that satisfies the conditions for constant levels of consumption is not necessary to assure ecological sustainability. Ecological sustainability requires that the allocation of economic resources should not result in the instability of the economy-environment system as a whole.	Mick Common, Charles Perrings
Profits from violating controls on the use of a polluting input	Environmental and Resource Economics	1992	01	01	Abstract: Profits from violating the quota, charge and permit market systems are compared. The results indicate that, for a given permit price, the violation profits of the charge and permit market systems are the same and exceed the profits from violating a quota system if the optimal use of inputs in a compliant market is lower than the quota. It is also shown that, under a permit market system, the occurrence of violation decreases the equilibrium price of permits. This implies that the profits from violating a permit market are lower than violation profits of a charge system.	Ing-Marie Andr√©asson-Gren

Economics and ecology: a comparison of experimental methodologies and philosophies	Ecological Economics	1992	01	01	"Views of the proper role of experiments in (environmental) economics and ecology have developed quite differently. Economics has devoted the majority of effort to abstract theory, with experimentation coming in a distant second. Kagel quotes a colleague who illustrates a common perception among economists: ""I am a 'true believer' in microeconomic theory, and as a result I am perfectly willing to accept mathematical proofs without experimental evidence"". In contrast, ecology has focused on observation-based experiments as the primary mechanism of research, almost separate from the development of abstract theoretical ecology. Kareiva notes that ""sad truth is that ecological theory exists largely in a world of its own, unnoticed by mainstream ecology"". We explore why this divergence has developed and persisted. The main reason is that economists and ecologists differ in their assumptions regarding the objective function of a model. Economists generally assume the objective function is well-defined, ecologists view the function as unknown. We higlight recent research in environmental economics to illustrate the economist's approach to experimentation."	Jason F. Shogren, Clifford Nowell

Ecological economics and scientific controversies. Lessons from some recent policy making in the EEC	Ecological Economics	1992	01	01	Contrasting the very limited scientific evidence on the forest dieback issue with the sudden adoption of policies on air pollution decided in the FRG (1983-1984) and extended to the European Community (1985), we propose an interpretative framework for the real internalization process at work in what was tantamount to a social crisis for public opinion, the media and political actors. We conclude that open scientific controversies on some environmental issues (effects, causes, solutions) pave the way for some actors to use the issue for their own techno-industrial strategies quite alien to ecological constraints. In cases of very high uncertainties on impacts, it becomes impossible to apply conventional social cost-benefit analysis (SCBA) as an optimizing tool. We propose to develop economic analysis as a negotiation language and to give pride of place to the value of learning time and to the crucial role of technological pluralism as a condition for flexibility in the future.

Are there environmental limits to cost benefit analysis?	Environmental and Resource Economics	1992	01	01	Abstract: This paper considers the problem areas found in applying cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to projects involving environmental costs or benefits. This is particularly relevant given recent moves by the UK government to include environmental valuations in CBA exercises, and in other related appraisal activities, following the publication of the Pearce Report. The paper argues that a major problem lies in placing monetary values on non-market goods. The paper also addresses the problems of (i) differences between citizen and consumer values; (ii) complexity of ecosystems; (iii) irreversibility and uniqueness; and (iv) intergenerational equity and discounting. The extent to which CBA is an institution open to capture is also discussed.	Nick Hanley

Ecological economics of the Swedish Baltic Empire: An essay on energy and power, 1560-1720	Ecological Economics	1992	01	01	Sweden rose from relative obscurity to become the most powerful nation in northern Europe during the period 1560-1720 based on its prosperous metal industry - silver, copper and steel. The following essay addresses this period of history from an energy perspective and suggests, as others have, that the surplus energy of a nation is its basis for power. Sweden's energy came mainly from its forests which supplied its mines with wood and its metal-works with charcoal. This energy system, including hydropower, animal and man power, is analyzed using one of the thousands of charcoal-burners as a model for the main energy input - charcoal. The principles of sustainable use of Swedish forests are also addressed in an historical perspective.	Ulf Sundberg

Uncertainty, sustainability and change	Global Environmental Change	1992	01	01	This article offers an exploration of connections between sustainability, risk and uncertainty. Global environmental change and human sustainability are characterized as the challenge of managing change in dynamic systems riddled with uncertainty. A number of disciplines and intellectual traditions, including systems thinking, risk and ecology, are surveyed briefly as sources to inform an approach to this challenge. Approaches to managing risk and uncertainty are discussed, a typology of resilience constructed, and an approach to sustainability defined. The discussion is based on the three imperatives of constant change, everpresent uncertainty and ignorance, and an increasingly stressed interdependency between humans and the biosphere.	Stephen R.

Comparison of alternative nonmarket valuation methods for an economic assessment of a public program	Ecological Economics	1992	01	01	This paper contributes to the discussion of the problem of integrating ecological and economic costs of public programs for mosquito abatement. The study illustrates the economic optimum level that could equate marginal cost to marginal benefit. The case study of a Texas gulf coast county demonstrates that the current largely chemical control program has an estimated benefit cost ratio of about 1.9 whether based on the expenditure function approach or the contingent valuation method. Costs of short- and long-run damages to public health and the environment have not been estimated. However, residents would be willing to pay nearly double the current program cost for ecologically sensitive control measures as they are developed.	Kun H. John, Richard G. Walsh, Chester G. Moore
Neoclassical and institutional approaches to development and the environment	Ecological Economics	1992	01	01	Institutional economics is suggested as a more fruitful approach to environmental problems than the now dominant neoclassical paradigm. The historical background of institutionalism in the United States and Europe is given, as well as the main characteristics of this approach, i.e. holism, emphasis on institutional arrangements, pattern modelling, and emphasis on the political element of economics. Differences between neoclassical and institutional economics are elaborated with respect to the concept of economics (reductionist versus holistic), the approach to decision making (aggregated versus highly disaggregated), and the view of social and institutional change (public choice versus actor-network approach).

"Capital theory and the measurement of sustainable development: an indicator of ""weak"" sustainability"	Ecological Economics	1993	01	01	"The measurement of sustainable development is not without considerable difficulties, yet this should not detract from the positive advances that can be made in this direction. In this paper we present one form that a ""weak"" sustainability indicator can take. Derived from a simple but intuitive savings rule, it incorporates the idea that the level of overall capital stock should be non-decreasing. Although subject to qualification at this stage, some interesting results emerge from the application of the rule to 18 countries."	David W. Pearce, Giles D. Atkinson
Information, production and utility	Energy Policy	1993	01	01	Economic systems interact with their environment through material and energy use in production and consumption processes and release of waste products. In this paper, we extend the physical perspective to economic processes and treat production and consumption in analogous ways. This analogous treatment is achieved by focusing on information used to describe the change of state of materials, the complexity of the transformation process, and the connection between economic processes and environmental change. The physical model of production presented here provides a quantitative framework for exploring the role of technological change in an economic system that is treated explicitly as part of the ecosystem.

Intertemporal valuation in an unpredictable environment	Ecological Economics	1993	01	01	The inherent unpredictability of ecological systems is a vital feature for the development of theories at the interface between economics and ecology. Such unpredictability is caused by instabilities that are intrinsic parts of ecosystem function, succession and evolution. The complexity of ecological dynamics undermines the simple probabilistic treatment of uncertainty based on the equilibrium paradigm, common in traditional environmental economics. We investigate an important alternative by representing the dynamics of the biogeophysical system as an infinite sequence of instabilities. This leads to a stochastic process exhibiting an exponentially growing variance. Our analysis is carried out in a macroeconomic setting in a situation where the value system, here formalized in terms of risk-averse social welfare functions, contains at least two distinct aspects: consumption rate and the state of the environment. The central variables for intertemporal valuation, i.e. the time-dependent expected values of the two welfare function components, are calculated using the probability distribution describing the environmental dynamics. One result is that if the unpredictability of the environmental dynamics is taken into account, then the social discount rate for environmental existence values may well be negative.	Friedhelm R.

Sustainable development: Some interpretations and applications in the context of Indian agriculture	Structural Change and Economic Dynamics	1993	01	01	The problems of achieving sustainable development are explored in the context of Indian agriculture. The Green Revolution led to rising living standards, but unanticipated externalities caused a degradation of land resources. For non-green revolution areas, alternative sources of unsustainable development are identified. The inadequacy of standard analytical approaches to the issues of growth is considered, and the conclusion drawn that both ecological and social-political systems must evolve together to create an environment in which policies can successfully increase current living standards whilst protecting future production possibilities.

Sustainable development: An institutional approach	Ecological Economics	1993	01	01	"Our Common Future documented that the prevailing patterns of economic growth are ecologically not viable. A new economic policy is likely to be needed. This new policy might not be compatible with predominent (neoclassical) economic views. The notion of ""sustainable development"" will have to be adequately incorporated into economic theory with repercussions for, among other things, (i) the treatment of natural resources as factors of production as well as welfare determinants, (ii) valuation theory, (iii) the evaluation of market forces. The Dutch abatement policy regarding acid rain is analysed in this respect. It proved that the Dutch government gave more attention to the growth of industrial production, including the polluting ones, than to sound protection of the environment. It is argued that the integration of natural resources into the framework of economic theory is a prerequisite for environmental policy."	Hans Opschoor, Jan van der Straaten

Alternative nitrogen reduction policies in the M√§lar region, Sweden	Ecological Economics	1993	01	01	The load of nitrogen to the Stockholm archipelago from the M√§lar region, a drainage basin located on the east coast of Sweden, must be reduced in order to decrease eutrophication. Costs for two alternative nitrogen policies are estimated: (i) current policy defined as total costs for reducing the nitrogen emission at each source by 50%, and (ii) an alternative policy defined as the minimum cost for reducing the load of nitrogen to the Stockholm archipelago by 50%. Results demonstrate that the cost of the first alternative greatly exceeds the cost for the second alternative. One important reason is that in the second alternative the functioning of the M√§lar lake ecosystem as a nitrogen sink is accounted for, which implies cost savings since less man-made reduction is required at the emission sources. Another factor is the identification of a new ecological technology-restoration of wetlands-a low cost measure for reducing the load of nitrogen.	Ing-Marie Gren

Adaptation and the option value of uncertain environmental resources	Ecological Economics	1993	01	01	Just as ecology has benefited from the economic theory of optimization, economics can benefit from the ecological theory of adaptation. We examine the impact of short-term, non-genetic adaptive self-protection on the values individuals attach to uncertain prospective environmental resources. We demonstrate that collective provision of reductions in supply uncertainty does not necessitate a positive option value, given that uncertainty is influenced by the individual's ability to adapt through self-protection. We conclude that the total value of reducing the supply uncertainty of a natural resource is reflected in both the individual's option price payments for collective provision and in his willingness-to-pay for adaptation through self-protection. By ignoring adaptive self-protection, traditional benefit-cost analysis has systematically underestimated the total value of environmental resources that are characterized by uncertain supplies.

Strategies to overcome barriers to the development of sustainable agriculture in Canada: The role of agribusiness	Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics	1993	01	01	Abstract: Strategies to involve agribusiness in the development of sustainable agricultural systems have been limited by the lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework for identifying the most critical supportive policies, programs and regulations. In this paper, we propose an efficiency/substitution/redesign framework to categorize strategies for modifying agribusiness practices. This framework is then used to identify a diverse range of short, medium, and long-term strategies to be pursued by governments, community groups, academics and agribusiness to support the transition. Strategies discussed include corporate greening, ethical investment, changing the legal status of the corporaton, new business forms and the development of ecological economics.	R. J. Macrae, J.

Intergenerational transfers and the social discount rate	Environmental and Resource Economics	1993	01	01	Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between intergenerational asset transfers and the choice of the discount rate for use in cost-benefit analysis in a model of a competitive overlapping generations economy constrained by a socially managed exhaustible resource. Provided that there are no distortions in capital markets and that all agents hold perfect foresight, cost-benefit techniques will result in a Pareto efficient resource allocation if the discount rate is set equal to the market rate of interest. But since the path of the interest rate depends on the level of intergenerational transfers, cost-benefit techniques do not ensure a socially desirable distribution of welfare between generations; a social optimum will result only if intergenerational transfers are properly chosen and enforced. Decentralized private altruism may result in intergenerational transfers that both present and future individuals would agree are too small if members of the present generation attach positive weight to the general welfare of future generations, not simply their personal descendants. In a world where intergenerational transfers are non-optimal, second-best policy-making may imply a constrained optimum that is inefficient. Together, these findings suggest that cost-benefit analysis is at best a partial criterion to policy formulation that should be used only in conjunction with ethical principles that define the proper distribution of welfare between present and future generations.

A framework for modelling economy-environment-development relationships based on dynamic carrying capacity and sustainable development feedback	Environmental and Resource Economics	1993	01	01	Abstract: A large literature exists that deals with economic issues of development and growth. It includes various approaches that can be classified as formal-theoretical, empirical-statistical and qualitative-verbal. Recently, the issue of sustainable development has been discussed much, which has given rise to some novel views on the relationship between development and environment. Most of these contributions utilize a more or less qualitative approach. A comprehensive inquiry of the relationship between economy, development, growth and environment may include an analytical approach as well. An analytical framework is proposed here for studies of environment-economy-development relationships that separates between economy, development, environment, and value system. A distinction is made between direct and indirect economy-environment interactions. To overcome disadvantages of assumptions of determinism in long term analysis a sustainable development feedback mechanism is proposed. It reflects anticipative behaviour to natural environmental changes in making long term decisions. This can be seen as a specific element of endogenous growth, namely one based on environmental factors. To illustrate the ideas a number of theoretical models are discussed that can be regarded as dynamic formal extensions of the concept of carrying capacity. Different cases include combinations of internal and external feedback mechanisms to an economy. The results demonstrate that in addition to behaviourial patterns that have been obtained by more complex studies other patterns may emerge.	Jeroen C. J. M. Van Den Bergh

Biological diversity: The international management of genetic resources and its impact on biotechnology	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	This paper discusses the approaches to safeguard biological diversity which were adopted at the Earth Summit. After addressing the benefits of biological diversity which are related to innovations in the biotechnology industry, it shows that project-related support can overcompensate for its administrative deficiencies by avoiding rent-seeking. The control of environment-friendliness can serve as an effective, although insufficient second-best instrument unless a consistent compensation rule is found that ensures both compliance and efficiency. The paper also shows that the agreed-upon preferential access of developing countries to patented biotechnological products will encounter many problems.	Frank St√§hler
Primary and secondary values of wetland ecosystems	Environmental and Resource Economics	1994	01	01	Abstract: Wetlands are continuously degraded in many parts of the world. One reason is the lack of the appropriate valuation of the multifunctionality of wetland. In an attempt to improve the understanding of the importance of this feature of wetlands an alternative classification of values is suggested; primary and secondary values. Primary value refers to the development and maintenance of ecosystems - their self-organizing capacity. Secondary values are defined as the outputs, life-support functions and services, generated by wetlands. Methods for measuring these values are discussed. Three case studies are presented which use different valuation methods and which to different degrees capture the primary and secondary values. It is concluded that only part of the total wetland value can be captured in monetary terms.	Ing-Marie Gren, Carl Folke, Kerry Turner, Ian Batemen
The role of thermodynamics in the study of economic and ecological systems	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"Economic theory has always maintained that economic value is ""generated"" solely within the economy where it is fully distributed among the factors of production before being ""consumed"". According to this theory, the economy is an isolated system that does not need flows to pass across its boundaries in support of its steady state (""general equilibrium""). From a thermodynamic point of view this idea is unacceptable. According to thermodynamic theory, any open system, which allows flows of matter and energy to cross its boundaries, is capable of maintaining itself in steady state only because it ""transport"" value from its environment to restore the value that has been ""consumed"" within the system and dissipated. Drawing on the analogy with thermodynamics, this paper replaces the traditional systemic analog of the economy, which is the closed ""circular flow"" process, with the steady flow process. According to this analog, any efficient economy is an open system both physically and economically requiring a ""flow"" of economic value to maintain its steady state. In other words, an economically isolated system has to be inefficient and is bound to misallocate and overuse environmental resources. Whether the economy behaves as an economically isolated (inefficient) or open (efficient) system is an empirical question. However, if real economies are economically open and efficient, and environmental resources are abused due to the economy's unrestrained material growth, parts of traditional economic theory, espicially those related to benefit evaluation, will have to be modified. Policy recommendations will be affected in any case because internalization, the panacea of resource misallocations, cannot be more than a temporary solution. Instead of opening the economy, internalization encloses the harmed resource and saves it by abusing excessively other environmental resources."	Shmuel Amir
Some notes on the misuse of classic writings in economics on the subject of common property	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"This paper aims to show how many economists have misunderstood the issues and language concerning ""the commons"". First, they confuse the noun, ""common property"", with the process of free and unregulated access. Second, they explain the disappearance of common-property resources as an unavoidable consequence of individual economic rationality. This process supposedly is based on Adam Smith's use of selfishness, but clearly is a misinterpretation of his basic writings. Ironically, Smith's writings, which, in toto, advocate great legal, political and moral restraint in economic action, are most commonly used to advance opposite ends. Given that planet Earth may be considered a common property, the clarification and proper use of common property issues is of the utmost importance."	Federico Aguilera-Klink
Niche diversification in environmental/ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"This paper is devoted to the identification and comparison of the niches of neoclassical environmental economics (NEE) and ecological economics (ECO). It is presented in four sections. Section 1 argues that the existing literature does not make the differences and relations between the sister disciplines neatly transparent. Section 2 critically examines the antecedents of the subjects with reference to three structural dimensions, such as scarcity perception, problem-solving orientation and range of integration. Section 3 collates the elements and reformulates the definitions. Section 4 is coda on the essay. The divide between the paradigms which came to the surface during the 1960s became prominent through the ""growth controversy"" of the subsequent decade. The controversy over the need for change of economic theory to cope with the growing intensity of environmental uncertainty makes the disciplines sore about each other. The neoclassical paradigm comprising of elements like relative scarcity, allocative approach, market correction and technological optimism characterises NEE. The distinguishing characteristics of ECO include thermodynamic irreversibility, absolute scarcity, economy-ecosystem symbiosis, biophysical approach, ecological stewardship and prudent pessimism. The niches are competitive and complementary in some respects, and thus provide a unique example of fruitful niche diversification within environmental/ecological economics. We have a feeling that the economics profession can trace out the interface of the disciplines in some policy areas and raise the effectiveness of prescriptions so that this academic species diversity can serve humankind to its full potential."

Actors, ideology, markets. Neoclassical and institutional perspectives on environmental policy	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	This essay is a critical examination of three well-known textbooks of neoclassical environmental economics concerning their treatment of environmental policy. Dynamic efficiency in the sense of cost-benefit analysis of a monetary kind is not the value-neutral instrument to project and policy evaluation it purports to be. Measuring willingness to pay and other market values does not solve many problems if the issues is one of world view, ideology and life-styles. As an alternative to conventional approaches, a more open attitude to various ideological standpoints in society is recommended. Neoclassical textbooks emphasize the government as the main agent in environmental policy and classify policy instruments as either belonging to the command-and-control or the economic incentives category. A broadening of perspective is here suggested in the sense of including many more agents of environmental policy; for instance, business companies and public interest groups. Environmental policy starts rather at the level of individuals than governments. A distinction is made between monetary and non-monetary incentives and disincentives as ways of influencing behaviour, and alternatives to the neoclassical view of man, business and markets are suggested for purposes of understanding social change.

Environmental norms, society, and economics	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"Environmental norms seem to be on the upsurge everywhere. Norm-orientation is, however, neglected in neoclassical economics, which is fixed on Homo economicus as the model of human behaviour. The paper addresses the question whether Homo economicus needs to give way to a norm-oriented concept in environmental economics. This question is tackled in an interdisciplinary and evolutionary approach. Using economics concepts, forces are identified which are detrimental to or which promote environmental norms in the process of civilisation. This investigation provides some clues on the likely importance of environmental norms in a future ecologically oriented society. These clues provide in turn one answer to the fundamental question posed, whether the neoclassical concept of human behaviour will likely remain or cease to be the ""standard"" tool in environmental economics. Rather than tackling the question in greatest generality, the analysis takes recourse to an example: the problem of the commons. The commons is particularly suited for this investigation because it is well roamed by all the disciplines which are of relevance for the undertaking."	Ernst Mohr
The environment and interdisciplinarity ecological and neoclassical economical approaches to the use of natural resources	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"This paper deals with the problem scientists from different disciplines have in communicating across disciplinary borders on matters pertaining to environmental problems. The paper gives a short presentation of the problem, a description of one possible theoretical framework to discuss this within, and an analysis of why and on what items one would expect economists and ecologists to agree or disagree. This is used to formulate some ideas on the distinction between inter- and multidisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity is seen as the reflected and often meticulous effort to interpret and translate research findings between different sciences or ""paradigms"". Openness and complementarily are stressed."	Paul O. Vedeld
In defense of health-based standards	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"This paper explores the utilitarian ethical foundations underlying two standards for pollution control: an efficiency standard and a health-based standard. The main point is that a health-based standard can be defended quite easily on utilitarian grounds; safety proponents need not be self-serving, irrational nor ignorant. Criticism of health-based standards as ""too costly"" is not always persuasive since material consumption is not the only component of social welfare, nor do consumption increases necessarily increase social welfare."

Integration of environmental concerns into economic analyses of projects and policies in an operational context	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	The efficient use of natural resources (both mineral and biological), as well as man-made capital and human resources, is a vital prerequisite for economic and social development. One key role of ecological economics is to help value environmental and natural resources more precisely, and internalize the cost and benefits of using such resources into the decision-making process. This paper reviews current economic approaches to the analysis of projects and policies and discusses possibilities for better intergrating environmental concerns into public decision-making. It reviews current practices as they relate to project analysis, the analysis of economic policies, and national income accounting. A major need at present is not for more theory or techniques, but for application of existing methodology and approaches to concrete problems, particularly in developing countries. The major objective should not be to provide fine-turned numbers, but to indicate orders of magnitude. Some project and policy alternatives can be ruled out in this fashion. Also, one can often identify the key estimates to which the decision is sensitive and focus more refined analyses on them. Cost-benefit analysis should be used to the extent possible. Alongside, one needs to consider and, to the extent possible, rigorously analyze consequences and risks that cannot be measured in monetary terms and use, for example, multi-criteria analysis where possible. This, together with sound judgement, are at present the best inputs into decision-making.	Ernst Lutz, Mohan Munasinghe
An open economy model of the effects of unilateral environmental policy by a large developing country	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	In this paper, we pose the following question. Why is it that despite the universal recognition of the need for global environmental protection, developing countries have been lax in instituting stringent environmental regulations? Addressing this question from an economic standpoint, we show that there are plausible theoretical circumstances in which a large developing country can be worse off if it chooses to implement environmental policy in an uncoordinated fashion. The empirical dimension of this question is stressed and the key parameters - such as elasticities and marginal propensities to consume - which are germane to any policy discussion regarding this issue are identified. Second, we study - once again from the perspective of a large developing country - the possibility of using the domestic tax structure optimally to attain environmental policy objectives in a second-best environment. This scenario involves taxing pollution indirectly, by using product taxes. Finally, keeping the empirical dimension of the question in mind, we show how to compute optimal externality correcting taxes. These taxes are primarily a function of different kinds of elasticities.

A synthetic analysis of market efficiency and constant resource stock for sustainability and its policy implications	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	Economic efficiency and ecological sustainability reflect different understandings and requirements for natural and environmental resource management. These two approaches can conflict in principle, but at the same time they can be complementary. A synthesis is suggested so that ecological sustainability could be realised with economic efficiency. With the introduction of a resource enhancement function, an optimal control model is constructed to investigate the efficient implementation of sustainability criteria. Further discussions are made on the policy implications arising from the synthesis and the transformation between physical capital (natural resources in situ) and capital gains (economic surplus) in a market control process.

Sense of place: geographic discounting by people, animals and plants	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	People, animals and plants seem to consistently prefer to distance themselves from objects they fear and draw close to things that they desire. I present an argument for ecologists and economists which allows them to capture this behavior in a simple way. I offer some evidence for how such behavior occurs and how to include it in specific formulation of environmental policy models.	Bruce Hannon
Aggregate estimate of environmental degradation for Zimbabwe: Does sustainable national income ensure sustainability?	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	Standard measures of economic growth do not adequately reflect changes in aggregate welfare over time. Sustainable national income is therefore defined as Net National Product with adjustments for the degradation of renewable and non-renewable capital. Productivity loss rather than replacement cost is the most theoretically correct way to value resource depletion. Modified net product is estimated for the agriculture and forestry sectors of Zimbabwe by valuing the loss of forest stock and soil erosion. The results show that traditional measures overstate the value of the agricultural sector's product by approximately 10% in 1989. It is argued that indicators of sustainable national income do not ensure sustainable development; as with all macroeconomic indicators, they do not account for distributional and equity issues which are at the crux of sustainable development, nor do they point to mechanisms that would ensure sustainable resource management. Rising sustainable income over time is therefore a necessary but not sufficient condition for the achievement of sustainable development.	W. Neil Adger, Florian Grohs
Environmental impairment liability as an instrument of environmental policy	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	This paper evaluates the role of liability that may arise in the context of an impairment of the environment. Environmental Impairment Liability (or EIL for short) is analyzed as an instrument of environmental policy. Interrelationships between injurers, victims, the legal system, insurers, and the environment serve to show that EIL may contribute to preserve the environment. However, peculiarities such as mass torts and uncertain behavior of courts serve to detract from the effectiveness of EIL. The question arises of whether these shortcomings are 1 mitigated or exacerbated by EIL insurance. The potential contribution of insurance to EIL is found to be undermined by partial market failure, which, however, can be alleviated by permitting the flotation of environmental risk warrants on capital markets.

Double CO2 and beyond: benefits, costs and compensation	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"Economic decisions over what action, if any, to take concerning the greenhouse effect tend to revolve around the social discount rate. Implicitly the debate concerns how to attribute intertemporal weights to welfare and implies a moral stance that is rarely given explicit recognition. Refocusing on the outcomes of current actions emphasises the role of ""compensation"". A conflict is apparent between the view that the current generation need be unconcerned over the loss or injury caused to future generations because they will benefit from advances in technology, investments in both man-made and natural capital, and direct bequests; and the requirement to avoid harming the innocent. Changes in units of welfare cannot be viewed as equivalent regardless of their direction. In general, doing harm is not cancelled out by doing good. The result is a rejection of the potential compensation principle which underlies the current economic stance, and a reconsideration of the acceptability of ""compensation"" altogether. The concept of human rights and a non-utilitarian perspective are used to show how cost-benefit analysis denies the existence of inalienable rights, and economics limits the moral considerability of harm."

Antarctic minerals and conservation	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	The Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty agreed in October 1991 on an Environmental Protocol which, if ratified, will preclude mining in Antarctica for 50 years. Moves to preclude exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources are motivated by concern about possible environmental damages associated with mining. Extraction of Antarctic minerals is currently unprofitable, but could become economically important in the future. Allocative efficiency, risk aversion, and inter-generational fairness criteria are employed in this paper to consider the merits of the proposed Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty. The Environmental Protocol is judged to provide an appropriate combination of environmental protection whilst maintaining the possibility of future mineral extraction.	Ross Cullen
Ethics and the limits of environmental economics	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	The purpose of this paper is to establish the limits of the cost-benefit framework used by environmental economists given the acceptance of an ethic of environmental concern. Two approaches to environmental ethics will be considered - one based on the view that human beings are the focus of moral concern, and another based on the notion that moral concern can be extended to the non-human natural world as well. If human beings are morally considerable, cost-benefit analysis can be legitimately applied to environmental issues involving the pursuit of human well-being so long as those who suffer losses from environmental damage are adequately compensated. However, the application of cost-benefit analysis to environmental issues is inconsistent with the moral considerability of human beings in cases where environmental damage is harmful to human health and in cases where the natural environment is so highly valued that the compensation of damaged parties is infeasible. Moreover, cost-benefit analysis cannot be legitimately applied where non-human natural entities are viewed as morally considerable.	Douglas E. Booth
On the possibility of attaining environmental and trade objectives simultaneously	Environmental and Resource Economics	1994	01	01	Abstract: With the greening of political debate around the world, large nations - precluded from using trade instruments explicitly - have become aware of the fact that they can manipulate their domestic tax structure to attain environmental and trade objectives simultaneously. In this note we show how such nations can attain these two targets with one instrument. Specifically, we show how to construct dual purpose taxes. We then focus on the empirical determinants of these taxes.	Amitrajeet A. Batabyal
Australian forests: Resource security or national heritage	Sustainable Development	1994	01	01	In Australia, the debate has intensified with respect to the continued logging of old-growth forests and export of woodchips. This has developed into antagonism between conservationist groups on one side, and a coalition of trade unions and business enterprises on the other. Much of the antagonism has been played out in the political arena around the issue of 'resource security' legislation. The specific legislation was defeated in 1992, but it is argued herein that this has not and will not conclude an on-going debate around similar issues. The material consequences of economic recession have provided an interdependency between agents of the working class and capital to exploit native forests for the full value of the existing timber. This coalition of interests is having an effect not only on political discourse and policy determination but even the valuation of forest ecology itself. This paper examines the economic, technical and ethical parameters of that debate and concludes that the material interests of labour and capital will be pertinent to long-term outcomes. The first man who, having enclosed a piece of land, thought of saying 'this is mine' and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. How many crimes, wars, murders; how much misery and horror the human race would have been spared if someone had pulled up the stakes and filled in the ditch and cried out to his fellow men: Beware of listening to this imposter. You are lost if you forget that the fruits of the earth belong to everyone and that the earth itself belongs to no onel (Rousseau 1984; p. 109).	Herb Thompson, Julie Tracy
Some comments on depletion and degradation costs in income measurement	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	This paper discusses the controversy regarding adjustments needed to be introduced in National Accounts to determine sustainable income measures. The issue is presented separately for depletion and degradation costs in order to take into account inter- and intratemporal considerations. It is argued that the approaches proposed in recent literature to measure natural resources depreciation can be considered as special cases of a distinct sustainability hypothesis. Apart from these theoretical issues, sustainable income measurement also entails very difficult empirical questions.	Ronaldo Ser√¥a da Motta

Estimating the costs of environmental protection in Brazil	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	In this paper an effort is made to estimate the amounts of money the government of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, must transfer to counties in which environmentally protected areas of any sort have been established by the state. A methodology to estimate these transfers is proposed, based on the potential loss of production in the protected areas, and the corresponding amounts are calculated. The results indicate that protecting 7.68% of the state's territory will cause a maximum decrease in its GDP of 0.05%. The estimation of monetary values for environmental costs is of interest because it provides a basis for judgement among different environmental protection alternatives and between these and other investment projects.

Ethics and economics of conservation	Biological Conservation	1994	01	01	Nature can be valued in its own right or as an instrument for the benefit of humankind. The second valuation, although less fundamental from a philosophical point of view, is sufficient to substantiate conservation as a moral duty. The harm done to future human beings in burdening them with the prospect of life in an ecologically impoverished world cannot be justified by moral standards of a civilized society when we consider the fact that conservation costs are not excessive.Species and ecosystems can be thought of as economic resources possessing special properties: they can be irreversibly destroyed, their future usefulness is a matter of uncertainty, their services are difficult to replace and they exhibit properties of public goods. All aspects combined, prudence suggests that we must as far as possible prevent extinctions.Even from a purely anthropocentric point of view it is logically impossible to assess the full monetary value of an irreversibly destructible ecological asset because for this purpose we would need to know the valuations of all future human beings. It is meaningless, therefore, to ask how much money a species is 'worth'. However, monetarization is possible within a limited scope. Many benefits obtained from species are amenable to evaluation in monetary terms. Independently, willingness-to-pay studies disclose the subjective value people place on species and biotopes.Despite numerous methodological problems, the costs of conservation can in most cases be assessed at least approximately. In principle, they amount to the maximum monetary benefit foregone if profitable but nature-adverse activities are displaced by conservation. Many empirical studies reveal low conservation costs by macroeconomic standards. In Germany, many conservation objectives in forests could be achieved virtually without any cost at all. A rather ambitious hypothetical conservation programme mainly for the agrarian countryside would bring about social costs of one thousand million DM per year. According to a first estimate, willingness-to-pay amounts to at least three thousand million DM per year.	Ulrich Hampicke

Regulating the environment: Changing from constraint to gentle coercion	Business Strategy and the Environment	1994	01	01	This article examines the changes in regulatory practices which have taken place in Denmark over the last twenty years. Danish environmental policy has been subject to several rounds of regulatory reform, aimed at streamlining existing regulation and making it more effective. Several new policy instruments have in this process been added to the regulatory repertoire, increasing the flexibility of the regulatory system. The strategic approach to the development and implementation of environmental policy, adopted by the Danish government, marks a change of regulatory regime, i.e. a change in the way environmental problems are perceived and in the choice of instruments to remedy these problems. The article argues that this is the result of the regulatory learning processes, and that the emerging regulatory regime, based on cooperation, represents a different way of harnessing the market forces than traditionally advocated. The article concludes that this regulatory regime opens up for a more systemic approach to preventing pollution.	Susse Georg
The worth of a songbird: ecological economics as a post-normal science	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	One of the very valuable features of Ecological Economics is its provision for publications under the rubric 'Commentary'. In that way, essays which are not research in the strictest sense can still find proper refereed publication, and can be submitted to the further test of open colleague criticism. This paper is intended to be read in that spirit; and where criticisms are made of the work of particular scholars, that is done because of the significance of their contribution.	Silvio O.

Discounting in a world of limited growth	Environmental and Resource Economics	1994	01	01	Abstract: This paper explores the consequences fordiscounting of assuming limits to growth. One of the main determinants of the discount rate is the rate of economic growth. If growth rates decline in the future then the discount rate should not be constant but also decline over time. In fact, we would then need not a single discount rate but rather a variable discount schedule. This would imply higher present values for the distant future. The paper analyses how discount rates would vary with different assumptions about the patterns of growth and the pure rate of time preference.	Thomas Sterner
"Trade, development and sustainability - a critical assessment of the ""free trade dogma"""	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	"Mainstream economic theory argues that trade, and especially free trade, isbeneficial to everyone involved. This fundamental idea - which has the character of a dogma - still plays an important role in international discussions on trade issues, notably in relation to development and environment. The purpose of this article is to critically assess the ""free trade dogma"" and to investigate the validity of widely used arguments concerning the relations between trade and development and between trade and environment. It is argued that the trading system is not something inherently good, and especially, the developing countries' benefits from trade have been very dubious. Furthermore, the trading system has contributed to environmental problems in several ways, e.g., generating undervaluation of natural resources, stimulating economic growth with environmental deterioration as a consequence, and ""magnifying"" and creating externalities. The critical approach makes a case for reducing trade."	Inge R‚àÖpke

The North American Free Trade Agreement: An ecological-economic synthesis for the United States and Mexico	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	The prospect of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has alarmed environmentally concerned professionals and citizens because of potential for exacerbated environmental destruction in each country. The concern in the trade and business community is that provisions for environmental protection would hobble the trade agreement and could effectively negate the positive economic benefits. The purpose of this paper is to consider the various environmental and economic implications of NAFTA and suggest policies that should allow for both a functional NAFTA and environmental protection. This paper summarizes the various potential environmental impacts along with existing free-trade mechanisms for environmental protection. It evaluates the rationale for a transition from current free-trade doctrines to those of sustainable free trade. Also recommended are several suggestions including the creation of a companion North American Environmental Protection Treaty(NAEPT). This treaty would contain trade-related policies beneficial to the environment, but inappropriate to a trade agreement. It would include short-term expansion of GATT articles for protection of the environment, and longer-term transformation of GATT into a General Agreement on Trade and the Environment (GATE). A form of countervailing duties called recompensing duties, and a form of Pigovian tax called a retributive environmental impact (REI) tax designed to ease adverse social, economic and environmental impacts during the transitional period of upward harmonization of standards are proposed. Specific recommendations for NAFTA, NAEPT and GATE are provided.	Edward B. DeBellevue, Eric Hitzel, Kenneth Cline, Jorge A. Benitez, Julia Ramos-Miranda, Olman Segura
Needed: examples of applying ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1994	01	01	Nothing is as effective as examples in conveying the usefulness of ecological economics to present and potential practitioners. I suggest ten example areas or problems where ecological economics can and should make specific analyses and recommendations. One example: a resolution, or creative rephrasing, of the dichotomous views of Japan that contrast its economic successes with its precarious dependence on imported renewable and nonrenewable resources and its high population density. For background, I also briefly review nine efforts to date in the general direction of total environmental cost.	Robert Herendeen

Cost efficient pesticide reductions: A study of Sweden	Environmental and Resource Economics	1994	01	01	Abstract: The minimum cost for reducing the farmers' use of pesticides is calculated. The measures include are; (i) a decrease in use of inputs, (ii) an improvement of the insurance system, and (iii) application of an ecotechnology where 5-10 meters along the borders of the fields are left untreated with pesticides. The cost of reducing the use of pesticides is measured by means of pesticide demand functions and the cost for improving an insurance system is measured as the risk premium. The empirical results indicate that the minimum cost for reducing the use of pesticides by 50% in Sweden corresponds to about 6 per cent of farmers' incomes from crop production. A simple comparison of policy instruments shows that the cost of a quota system is about 40 per cent higher than the costs of the charge and permit market systems. The farmers' decreases in incomes under a charge system are twice as high as under the other two policy instruments. The results are, however, sensitive to the levels of the pesticide price elasticities.	Ing-Marie Gren
Threshold effects and incentives for the conservation of biodiversity	Environmental and Resource Economics	1994	01	01	Abstract: Biological diversity is a central component of the stock of natural capital on which all economic development is based. Other things being equal, loss of biologically diversity implies loss of development potential, and its conservation through sustainable use or outright protection implies the protection of that potential. One characteristics of biodiversity loss of especial importance is that biodiversity loss, more than any other current environmental problem, is associated with ecological threshold effects. The paper explores the implication of this characteristics for the properties of a biodiversity conservation strategy.	Charles Perrings, David Pearce

Employment creation and green development strategy	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	Employment creation has received surprisingly little attention in the literature on environmental economics. This paper argues for closer ties between sustainable development and employment-creating development at both the global and the national levels of planning and policy. The paper briefly reports on the employment challenge confronting Indonesia to highlight the jobs-versus-environment dilemma facing a developing country that is rich in natural resources but densely populated. It is argued that the high-income countries of the North should take the initiative in raising funds through ecotaxes, levies on international trade and other appropriate income policies in order to increase investment flows for job-creating development in the South to make sustainability a practical reality.

Preferences, information and biodiversity preservation	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	This paper considers the nature of preferences for the preservation of biodiversity, and the extent to which individuals are well-informed about biodiversity. We present evidence that the elicitation of monetary bids to pay for biodiversity preservation, as required for cost-benefit analysis, fails as a measure of welfare changes due to the prevalence of preferences which neoclassical economics defines as lexicographic. That is, a significant proportion of individuals refuse to make trade-offs which require the substitution of biodiversity for other goods. In addition, we show that understanding of the biodiversity concept is extremely limited, raising concerns over a reliance on stated preferences, as revealed in contingent valuation studies, for decision-making on this issue. Results from two samples (students and the general public) are described.	Clive L. Spash, Nick Hanley
Ecology, sustainability, and environment as capital	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	"The idea of environment as capital has found widespread support in both the economic and ecological literature. It is often suggested in a related sustainability literature that natural capital should remain intact if possible. The popularity of this approach to exploring the human-environment relationship is due, in part, to the way it is seemingly legitimised by ecological theory and practice. This legitimation is important for emerging areas of human-environment study, such as ecological economics, because ecology and other natural sciences have often dismissed economic constructions of the environment. However, a closer examination of the state of contemporary ecology suggests that there are problems with an ecological legitimation of the ""environment as capital approach."" First, ecology itself is a troubled discipline and its ability to provide a comprehensive theory of human-environment interactions is limited. Second, emerging ecological discourse tends to undermine the ecological rationale for many natural-capital-related resource management recommendations. This does not mean that the environment as capital concept is without considerable heuristic power. It does imply, however, a need to return to a social construction of the environment in which different environmental possibilities are valued in terms of their potential contribution to human well-being."

Development, trade, and the environment: which way now?	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	In recent times, environmental protection has emerged to occupy much of the center stage in discussions of economic development. The fact that most-if not all-developing countries trade with each other has given the concept of environmental protection a distinctively international focus. In this note, I identify and discuss five of the most important themes in trade and the environment that are likely to impact developing countries in a significant manner in the future.	Amitrajeet A.

The contribution of the mining sector to sustainability in developing countries	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	Does the mining sector contribute to, or detract from, the achievement of sustainable development in developing countries? Sustainability is defined as development that will give future generations opportunities equal to or greater than those of the present generation. Treating gross income per capita as an imperfect proxy of these opportunities, a test is made to investigate whether increases in mining GDP have led to long-run increases in GNP per capita despite the exhaustibility of mineral deposits. This is a more encompassing criterion than the conventional Hartwick criterion which establishes necessary conditions for the achievement of a related definition of sustainability. A vector autoregression model (VAR) is estimated for each of 19 non-OPEC developing countries with large mining sectors. Using the impulse response functions, the long-run multiplier of mining income on GNP is calculated. The sustainability criterion developed in the paper requires the multiplier to exceed a minimum value. This test is carried out under alternative assumptions regarding future mining income.	David I.

Corporate environmental and resource management: In search of a new managerial paradigm	European Journal of Operational Research	1995	01	01	Sustainable development is close to becoming the catchword of the 1990s, but it is still far from being an operational concept for individual companies. This paper attempts to transform the Brundtlandian contradictory of Sustainable development into a corporate and more operational concept. As it is argued, economists' interest in the environment is not new. Whether to implement sustainable corporate environmental and resource management practices or not is no longer a real choice for industrialists today, given the ultimate limitations of Nature - limitations that are close to being reached. The implications of such a new corporate development philosophy will be far-reaching, however. The new managerial paradigm, which is outlined here, challenges not only the way in which industry is run today, but attacks the very bedrock on which mainstream economics is based.	John P. Ulh√∏i

What forms of rationality for sustainable development?	Journal of Socio-Economics	1995	01	01	"This article aims to help the decision-making process in the matter of sustainable development. The real dividing lines between different analyses of sustainable development are drawn on the basis of two methodological questions. The first concerns the effective inclusion or exclusion of the ecological dimension; the second concerns the choice of a rationality hypothesis. From this perspective, we explain that neoclassical theory and conventional ecology are both insufficient because they rest respectively on an economic or ecological substantive rationality. Then we posit that the analysis of the London School constitutes an attempt to combine the ecological and economic dimensions of development. However, this approach does have its limitations, ultimately using an hypothesis of expanded economic rationality that nevertheless remains basically substantive. Last, we show how an ""ecological-economic"" approach based on a procedural conception of rationality also employing economic- and energy-based valuation methods seems to cover more comprehensively the issues of sustainable development involving the coordination of diverse rationalities and diverse dimensions of sustainability."

Problems in valuing the benefits of biodiversity protection	Environmental and Resource Economics	1995	01	01	Abstract: This paper considers two problems in valuing the benefits of biodiversity protection. These are, firstly, that preferences for biodiversity protection may be lexicographic rather than utilitarian. The more individuals for whom this is true, the less is cost-benefit analysis validated as a means of decision making for biodiversity protection, since lexicographic preferences are incompatible with the Kaldor-Hicks Compensation Test. Secondly, people may be poorly informed about the meaning of biodiversity, complicating the use of contingent valuation as a means of measuring preservation benefits. This paper first discusses the meaning of biodiversity, and trends in diversity over time. We offer some empirical evidence with regard to lexicographic preferences; consider the implications of having poorly-informed consumers; and then report the results of a contingent valuation study of biodiversity protection with varying levels of information. We find that willingness to pay for biodiversity protection increases with the level of information provided.	Nick Hanley, Clive Spash, Lorna Walker

"The environment as a luxury good or ""too poor to be green""?"	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	"This paper discusses the views of different authors on the relations between economic growth and environmental scarcities. It lays out the common assumptions behind Inglehart's postmaterialist thesis in environmental sociology, Krutilla's criterion for the valuation of environmental amenities, Hirsch's notion of the positional economy, and Pearce's numerical results on weak sustainability. The paper shows how different views on the environmental consequences of economic growth imply at the same time different theories about environmental movements. In rich countries, there is an increasing demand for environmental amenities which cannot be substituted by products of the material economy, and there are also environmental movements against the ""effluents of affluence"". In poor countries, there are environmental movements characterized as the ""environmentalism of the poor""."	J. Mart√≠nez-Alier
Convex combinations of recycling incentives	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	1995	01	01	A general equilibrium model is developed in which consumers turn in a used product when they purchase a new one. A portion of the spent output is recycled, with the remainder going to landfills and causing environmental damage. In this tightly constructed model, either a disposal tax on the landfilled waste, or a subsidy for recycling and an excise tax on the disposable good, or any convex combination of these incentives fosters the same efficient allocation of inputs into the production of disposable versus nondisposable goods, the manufacture of virgin raw material, and the reprocessing of used raw material.

Elicitation and truncation effects in contingent valuation studies	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	"The contingent valuation method (CVM) uses surveys of expressed preferences to evaluate willingness to pay for (generally) non-market, environmental goods. This approach gives the method theoretical applicability to an extensive range of use and passive-use values associated with such goods. However, recent years have seen the method come under sustained empirical and theoretical attack by critics who claim that the expressed preference statements given by respondents to CVM questions are subject to a variety of biases to the extent that ""true"" valuations cannot be inferred. This debate was reviewed and assessed in the recent report of the US, NOAA ""blue-ribbon"" panel which gave cautious approval to the method subject to adherence to a rigorous testing protocol. This paper reports findings from the first UK CVM study to generally conform to those guidelines. The major objective of the research reported on here is the analysis of the effects of altering the method of eliciting willingness to pay (WTP) responses. Three WTP elicitation methods are employed: open-ended questions (where the respondent is free to give any answer); dichotomous choice questions (requiring a yes/no response regarding a set WTP bid level); and iterative bidding questions (where a respondent is free to move up or down from a given WTP starting point). Results indicate that respondents experience significant uncertainty in answering open-ended questions and may exhibit free-riding or strategic overbidding tendencies (although this is less certain). When answering dichotomous choice questions respondents seem to experience much less uncertainty although the suggestion that bid levels affect responses cannot be ruled out, and it is clear that respondents behave somewhat differently to dichotomous choice as opposed to open-ended formats. The iterative bidding approach appears to provide a halfway house with respondents exhibiting certain of the characteristics of both the other formats. We concluded that the level of uncertainty induced by open-ended formats is a major concern, and that further research into the microeconomic motivations of individuals responding to iterative bidding and dichotomous choice CV surveys is high priority. A further aim of the analysis was to test for changes in estimated mean WTP induced by the application of different forms of truncation across all elicitation methods. Recommendations are made on appropriate truncation strategies for each elicitation method."	Ian J. Bateman, Ian H. Langford, R.Kerry Turner, Ken G. Willis, Guy D. Garrod

The Paretian Liberal Paradox and ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	"Two of the most basic considerations in collective choice are the Pareto principle and some minimal protection of individual rights. In his Impossibility Theorem, Sen (1970) shows that there is a potential inconsistency between preference sovereignty (as expressed by the Pareto condition) and the protection of minimal rights (a liberal or liberty condition). The Paretian Liberal Paradox (PLP), and the extensive debate surrounding it, prompts serious reconsideration of the traditional welfare economics approach. The critique of welfarism made by the PLP is of central importance for environmental issues given pervasive externalities, missing markets, uncertainty, and potential irreversibilities. Making collective choice decisions on these issues may require using explicit ""non-utility"" information and restricting individual preference sovereignty. We explore the implications of the PLP for long-term environmental policy and the transdisciplinary field of ecological economics. As a simple pedagogical device relying on sparse principles, the PLP stimulates an increased awareness of the potential conflict between preferences and rights. Recognition of the PLP focuses attention on what counts as admissible information in collective choice rules. For example, consideration of the PLP illuminates differences in the informational requirements of alternative sustainability concepts."	Robert P. Berrens, Stephen Polasky
Cumulative environmental assessment and global change	Environmental Impact Assessment Review	1995	01	01	This paper assesses the role of cumulative assessment in the context of global change. The case is made that it is no longer adequate to assess only the local or regional cumulative effects of development, but that global constraints must also be taken into account. The four- to five-fold expansion of economic activity since the Second World War has produced a level of material and energy exchange between the ecosphere and the economy that is already capable of irreversibly disrupting global life support and undermining global ecological stability. This ongoing trend permanently changes the relationship between humankind and the ecosphere. Society must now be prepared to contemplate the possibility that additional net material growth may be both uneconomic and ecologically unsustainable. In an economically full world, cumulative effects assessment should therefore assume a global perspective, adopting no net loss of essential natural capital and zero-impact growth as routine development objectives.

One world, one experiment: addressing the biodiversity-economics conflict	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	The self-organizing principles of markets that have emerged in human cultures over the past 10 000 years are inherently in conflict with the self-organizing principles of ecosystems that have evolved over the past 3.5 billion years. The rules governing the dynamics of ecosystems, within which all human activity takes place, are ultimately a function of biological laws, not a function of human-created economic systems. The conflict between these systems is illustrated by the fact that economic indicators have shown vigorous growth during the last century while a variety of environmental indicators have exhibited negative trends. Ultimately, however, the growth of human economies faces the constraints that limit all biological systems. In this article we outline the bases for the conflict between biological and economic activity and suggest policy approaches that will enhance the chances for creating cultures that are economically and environmentally sustainable.

A tax incentive tool for environmental management: an environmental scorecard	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	The purpose of this paper is to outline a recently developed environmental management tool, the environmental scorecard. The scorecard is an incentive-based instrument which established an explicit formula for determining the percentage of a property tax exemption a facility would receive. Tax exemption programs are typical economic development tools. However, they traditionally do not incorporate other factors than development criteria. This creates the possibility that economic development inducements can be contrary to environmental goals. The scorecard was designed to bridge the gap between the use of pure development and pure environmental management tools. It was actually implemented in Louisiana for one year before it was terminated for political reasons. This paper illustrates the application and costs to firms of the implemented scorecard.

The environmental cost of sustainable welfare	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	Welfare is a measure of the well-being of society. It is sustainable if it can be maintained steadily for many years. According to neoclassical economic theory, value-that is, the flow of welfare attributed to the totality of available outputs-is generated, distributed, and consumed solely within the economy. When environmental externalities are absent, or after they have been internalized, environment-derived welfare is constant, and no environmental costs need be incurred to sustain economy-derived welfare. Hence, resource accumulation and technological progress enable society to experience sustainable development futures where its welfare always increases, possibly exponentially. Thermodynamics generates an alternative theory of value. Drawing on this theory, I show that the sum of the economy-derived and environment-derived welfare is not affected by the location of the boundaries between the economy and the environment. Hence, to recognize their contribution to welfare, environmental resources need not be internalized into the economy. According to thermodynamics-based theory, economy-derived welfare may be sustained only because the economy is able to transport net value from its environment to restore the value that is necessarily consumed within it. Hence, the environmental costs of sustaining welfare are always positive. They increase with the welfare to be sustained and decrease as a consequence of technological advance. Since part of these costs will never disappear, the room for better technologies cannot be exhausted. Once solar power is fully utilized, future increase of welfare will be guided by the rate of adoption of more efficient technologies that slow down the economic process. Although welfare is bounded asymptotically and its steady growth is precluded, economy-derived welfare and the corresponding environmental costs are determined by social decisions rather than by immutable laws of nature.

Benefit-cost analysis at the EPA	Journal of Socio-Economics	1995	01	01	"This article employs a case study approach to examine two recent Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) of proposed regulations performed by the Environmental Protection Agency under Executive Order 12291. The first analyzes a micro-level decision: the allowable lead content in solder used in water pipes. The second RIA has a much broader focus, as it examines alternate design st andards for the nation's 6,000-plus municipal solid waste l andfills. Three questions are addressed. First, is the agency doing ""good"" benefit-cost? Second, do the benefit-cost studies actually influence policy decisions? Third, assuming an affirmative answer to the second question, does the benefit-cost process lead to ""better"" regulatory decisions?"	Eban Goodstein

Thermodynamic implications for natural resource extraction and technical change in U.S. copper mining	Environmental and Resource Economics	1995	01	01	Abstract: Motivated by the lack of integrated approaches that do justice to both the thermodynamic and economic aspects of natural resource use and the lack of empirical studies combining the two disciplines, this paper provides an integrated framework for the valuation of technologies, substitution and technical change. The paper determines empirically the relationships between thermodynamic states of materials and the use of high-quality energy sources for the case of copper mining in the United States. The empirical analysis provides the basis for a nonlinear dynamic simulation of optimal resource extraction and endogenous technical change in the light of changing resource quality. The study assesses the potential for future improvements in U.S. copper mining.	Matthias Ruth
Thermodynamic constraints on optimal depletion of copper and aluminum in the United States: a dynamic model of substitution and technical change	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	The paper proposes a methodology to integrate concepts from thermodynamics into economic models of optimal natural resource use and to empirically determine relationships between changes in thermodynamic states of materials and the use of high-quality energy sources. The integration is aimed at an assessment of technologies, substitution and technical change based on economic concepts that do justice to fundamental physical constraints. A model of natural resource use and production has been developed that combines econometric time series analysis with dynamic modeling techniques. The model explicitly includes thermodynamic constraints on (i) the process of separating minerals from crude ore, (ii) smelting processes, (iii) substitution among inputs, and (iv) endogenous technical change in mining, smelting and refining. Based on empirical information, the model has been simulated to assess outer limits of feasible resource savings in copper and bauxite mining, smelting and refining in the United States. Conclusions are drawn for the evaluation of products and effluents from mining, smelting and refining operations with regard to changes in the physical resource base and environmental quality.

Is sustainable growth optimal?	International Tax and Public Finance	1995	01	01	Abstract: This paper analyzes sustainable growth in a stochastic environment, with human extinction as a possible outcome. The basic constraint of sustainability is that consumption never decreases over an infinite horizon, which requires that the probability of extinction be maintained at zero. We show that this problem can be examined in a standard optimal-growth model. Under certain conditions, the solution of this problem is a corner solution with probability of survival equal to one, at the cost of economic growth. These conditions depend on the initial development level and on the elasticity of utility with respect to consumption. In some circumstances, which depend on the social discount rate, optimal-growth paths do not exist. In these situations, the sustainable-growth concept has a clear autonomy with respect to the usual optimality criterion.	Andrea Baranzini, Francois Bourguignon
Environmental problems inherent to a development style: degradation and poverty in Brazil	Environment & Urbanization	1995	01	01	This paper describes how a large proportion of Brazil's urban population still lacks provision for sanitation and, to a lesser extent, access to piped water, and how this is rooted in a society with a high degree of inequality and a growing number of urban poor. It also considers why environmental economics has failed to develop operational instruments to highlight the environmental and health costs of inadequate sanitation, the benefits of improved sanitation and the options available for addressing this problem.

No-regret potentials and technical innovation	Energy Policy	1995	01	01	This paper aims to demonstrate the advantages of a sequential approach to decision making in climate policies. This sequential approach is necessary because of the uncertainties regarding both the avoided costs of climate change and the costs of GHG emission abatement. This assessment focuses on the minimization of learning time, the reduction of technical and institutional inertia, and the possible unexpected non-linearities in abatement curves. A stylized representation of so-called 'no-regret' short-term potentials, of long-term innovation trends and of backstop technologies is used. We show that if we do take care of the inertia constraints in the decision process, both policies (namely the no-regret and the innovation process exploitation) becomes crucial in terms of minimization of the learning time.

Leading issues in domestic environmental regulation: A review essay	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	Due to a number of developments, the theory and practice of domestic environmental regulation has attained considerable significance. Just as some issues have receded in importance, others have emerged to occupy much of the present center stage. This paper identifies three principal issues in domestic environmental regulation and then proceeds to survey the most important parts of the literature as they pertain to these issues. The specific issues considered are (a) the impact of uncertainty, (b) enforcement and monitoring, and (c) aspects of intertemporal analysis and the problem of dynamic inconsistency.	Amitrajeet A.

A Value-Informed Framework for Interdisciplinary Analysis: Application to Recovery Planning for Snake River Salmon	Conservation Biology	1995	01	01	Economic and social variables, in addition to biological variables, are often critical forces in directing recovery planning for threatened and endangered populations. Although including these variables in scientific analyses for recovery planning may be important, there is little agreement on how to integrate the relevant disciplines. The dilemma associated with interdisciplinary collaboration is that, while a diversity of values and perspectives is unavoidable, this diversity stands as a barrier to agreement on an integrative research approach. We describe a general framework for interdisciplinary analysis designed to support recovery planning that does not rely on choosing a single interdisciplinary approach. Rather, it uses value conflicts potentially arising in an interdisciplinary setting to select a diverse set of scientific approaches relevant to a particular conservation effort. We apply this framework to recovery planning for threatened Snake River chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and examine the implications of conflicts over the acceptability of institutional change, technological solutions, and transferability of recovery effort across groups responsible for the current status of the species.

Theoretically efficient pricing for commercial uses of public land resources	Resources Policy	1995	01	01	Assuming free entry of firms to public lands and the consequent diminishment of their value as pure wilderness, there is an administered price per acre that fosters the theoretically efficient level of commercial use, such as mining, grazing or logging. That price equals households' marginal willingness to pay to preserve the public land as wilderness. It also equals the efficient price of private land times the ratio of the marginal commercial productivities of public to private land. The exceptions are the corner solutions in which the administered price either equals the marginal willingness to pay for wilderness, but exceeds the marginal revenue product of the land, in which case none of the land is used commercially, or else equals the marginal revenue product, but exceeds the marginal willingness to pay, in which case all of the land is used commercially.

A framework for scaling and framing policy problems in sustainability	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	It is argued that a necessary, but lacking, component of our approach in seeking policy responses to sustainability issues is some repeatable means whereby the relative magnitude and characteristics of these various policy problems faced in a given context can be analysed and described. To this end, a simple and tentative framework is constructed, based on the definition of the key attributes which shape policy problems pertaining to environmental change. These are: spatial scale of cause and effect; magnitude, timing and longevity of possible impacts; reversibility; mensurability; complexity and connectivity; nature of cause(s); relevance to the given polity; tractability (availability and acceptability of means); public concern; and existence of goals. These attributes inform a general taxonomy of micro-, meso- and macro-problems. The attributes and the taxonomy are described with supporting examples. To illustrate possible application of the framework, it is discussed briefly in the contexts of operationalising the 'precautionary principle', and policy instrument choice. It is concluded that the framework can help focus debate and operationalise vague principles, introduce relativity into the notion of sustainability, and make policy choice more efficient.	Stephen R.

Decision-making under environmental uncertainty	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	"The paper's main concern is with different decision-making models for environmental issues and with the hypotheses of rationality underlying such models. The hypothesis supported here is that most environmental problems are in a context of uncertainty, of irreversibility and of complexity. We shall explain why stressing the role of these elements implies a reversal of the traditional attitude towards decision-making. This presupposes a paradigm of economic rationality much broader that that of orthodox economics, called ""procedural rationality"". Our paper is in two parts. The first part concerns the limits of the stochastic environmental approaches based on the Bayesian decision theory and on a substantive rationality hypothesis. The second part concerns the decision-making analyses based upon a procedural rationality, as well as their ability to take account of the interactions between uncertainty, irreversibility and complexity."

Achieving Sustainability: Reform or Transformation?	Journal of Planning Literature	1995	01	01	"We have reached a unique juncture in human ecological history, one requiring a radical reconfiguration of planning values and goals. The ""ecological footprint"" of the global economy is already larger than the planet, yet a quarter of humanity still lives in poverty, the human family is expanding by 90 million a year, and material demands everywhere are rising. An unlikely tenfold reduction in the energy and material intensity of economic activity would be required to accommodate anticipated economic growth safely, posing an enormous challenge to planners in facilitating the transition to sustainability. Failure enhances the considerable possibility of global disaster."	William E. Rees
Information, order and knowledge in economic and ecological systems: implications for material and energy use	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	Ecological and economic systems are open systems that require energy to change the thermodynamic states of materials from naturally occurring to more valued forms. These changes are accompanied by information flows and changes in the order of systems and their surroundings. In this paper, thermodynamics is used to assess these system changes and relate them to the knowledge present in a system. Particular emphasis is given to (1) the fundamental relationships among material, energy and information flows, and changes in order and knowledge, (2) the role of equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics in assessing system change, (3) the increasing role of material and energy flows through economic systems, and (4) the necessity for improved societal valuation of these flows.

Corporatism as an impediment to ecological sustenance: the case of Finnish waste management	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	This study set out to improve the capacity of Finnish policy makers to design and implement long-term waste management policies. Since policy makers must frequently act on incomplete information and process the information they receive through mental models that can lead to inefficient or myopic choices, the methodological approach was to analyze the structure, substance, and institutional context of the mental models with which key policy makers in Finnish waste management rationalize their long-term decisions. Individual scenarios were analyzed for inconsistencies that indicate how institutions constrain policy decisions and what institutional changes might enable policy makers to better prepare for the long-term future. To map the cognitive models that underlie waste management policies, interviews were conducted in 1992 with 24 decision makers and experts on Finnish waste management. The main finding is that the exclusion of long-term ecological sustenance is a systemic, built-in characteristic of Finnish corporatism. Corporatist institutions nurture environmental policy makers' short-sighted mental models, which in turn are the rationale for the short-sighted corporatist institutions. The principle unifying the recommendations is the administrative and procedural separation of conflicting environmental policy interests, and the simultaneous empowering of sustainable goals with appropriate institutions.

The Poverty of Applied Policy Analysis	Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics	1995	01	01	'We always plan too much and think too little. We resent a call to thinking and hate unfamiliar argument that does not tally with what we already believe or would like to believe.' - Joseph Schumpeter, (1947, pg. xi) My objective today is to put forth a call for each of you to rethink how we do applied policy analysis. I plan to justify the need for this rethinking using a variety of arguments. Some of my arguments will be familiar to most if not all of you, others may be unfamiliar to most if not all. I claim no originality for the basic theoretical arguments, they all appear in the literature. What 1 hope you find to be original and useful is the synthesis of these arguments. Furthermore, though in places 1 will point out the need for additional theoretical work, my primary goal is to convince practicing agricultural policy analysts to become more comprehensive in their analyses. In the grand tradition of presidential addresses, my remarks cover a rather broad range of issues at the expense of depth on any one issue. Nevertheless, I hope that my remarks will stimulate discussion and thought about how we as agricultural economists do applied policy analysis.	William G. Boggess
Input-output economics and ecology	Structural Change and Economic Dynamics	1995	01	01	Without knowing, Professor Leontief, in the late 1960s, stirred my colleagues and I to produce a long list of articles on the energy and labor directly and indirectly needed to produce the multitude of products and services flowing from a modern economy. Our purposes grew out of a need to find a way for consumers to reduce their impact on the environment. In more recent years, the work turned toward the blending of economic and ecological theory and practice.	Bruce Hannon
International pollution control: a review of marketable permits-a comment	Journal of Environmental Management	1995	01	01	"Tomkins and Twomey 1994 offer an outline and discussion of the use of a marketable permit system (MPS) approach to address international pollution problems. Whilst the economic principles underpinning the use of MPSs is not disputed, it is argued that the nature of their associated discussion is misleading. It is suggested that they significantly underplay a variety of problems impacting on the negotiation, costs and practical application of the approach. In addition, the various incidental comparisons with the use of ""command and control"", and fiscal instruments therein, seem to imply general superiority of the MPS approach over these approaches to address international pollution problems. It is argued that this is not likely to be the case."	Alan Collins
Is sustainability optimal? Examining the differences between economists and environmentalists	Ecological Economics	1995	01	01	"This paper examines a number of possible explanations for the apparent differences between economists and environmentalists concerning economic growth and sustainable development. Some of the differences are well known and relate to issues such as resource scarcity, intergenerational equity, and the composition of social capital. However, our analysis finds that while economic notions of optimal growth and the techniques of benefit-cost analysis have important advantages for evaluating complex tradeoffs because they are quantifiable, they may have potentially serious drawbacks as well. The paper focuses on two potential sources of bias in the use of welfare economics for social choice: First, there is a ""conservative reinforcement"" in benefit-cost analysis which is likely to produce biases against policy interventions to protect a degraded environment. Second, and perhaps more importantly, the aggregation of individual willingness to pay as a measure of social benefits is shown to be invalid in the case of ""positional goods"", where the demand for the good reflects the desire of individuals to raise their own relative standing. This error may cause the economic calculus to be biased against non-positional goods, including non-rival goods such as environmental resources. These biases further complicate the already strained assumptions in utilitarian-based welfare economics that, by relying on revealed preference and consumer sovereignty, are unable to distinguish between, or apply different weights to, the satisfaction of different categories of preferences. Furthermore, because the dynamic consequences of even small biases in judging social optimality may give rise to large social costs or advance an unsustainable path, there is a danger in relying solely on a potentially biased measure of welfare as a basis for guiding social choice. The paper concludes by suggesting that efforts to correct these drawbacks of economic analysis are likely to result in approaches to sustainable development that narrow the apparent differences between economists and environmentalists."

AIR QUALITY POLICY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES	Contemporary Economic Policy	1995	01	01	Improved air quality can result from complex regulatory programs, comprehensive national policies, and technology-based standards. In the United States, gains have been real but costly in terms of direct expenditures for controls and agency costs. In other cases, where long-term commitment to the objective may be unsure, relying primarily on installation of state-of-the-art technology makes less sense because a flow of funds to maintain and operate the control devices is not guaranteed and the institutional costs may be large. In such circumstances, one cannot carry out the economic analysis necessary to justify pollution reduction on traditional grounds (MB=MC or TB>TC), or the analysis is likely to indicate that the investment is not worthwhile. Conversely, an analysis that leads policymakers to direct capital to newly installed control equipment may be based on the faulty assumption that the equipment will operate effectively. In the absence of a long-term institutional capacity to support use of technology in place, traditional assessment tools may lead to wrong and wasteful conclusions. Commitment to air quality improvements is necessary to justify paying for control equipment or modifying other policies. Commitment and success are complements. Policymakers would be more likely to commit if they had a clearer conception of the role that air quality plays in the economy and that the economy plays in air quality. Policies that economists traditionally do not view as environmental programs can produce large gains. Specifically, changing energy pricing policies will lead directly to cleaner air, at large savings to national governments. Investment in energy efficiency, including transit, will produce better air quality as a by-product. Implementing such straight-forward policies does not require extensive knowledge about pollution levels or sources or significant enforcement expenditures. Many regions eventually will need more direct regulation, either via economic incentives or control requirements, in order to achieve really healthy air. In the interim, worthwhile gains can be had inexpensively while long-term priorities and policies are developed. The analysis here advocates viewing air quality in a new way as a good or a service to be produced. Air quality is one of many basic needs. It increases productivity as well as directly enhancing human welfare through better health and an improved environment.	JANE VISE HALL

Status effects and environmental externalities	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	This paper examines a static, competitive economy where the production of a consumption good generates pollution that adversely affects human welfare. Preferences are defined over consumption, leisure, pollution, and economic status. Each person's status increases with her own consumption, but decreases with the average consumption of society. The achievement of a Pareto efficient resource allocation requires a consumption tax to offset the incentive to overconsume in the pursuit of enhanced status. In contrast with standard prescriptions, the efficient pollution tax generally exceeds the sum of individuals' marginal willingness to pay for pollution abatement. These findings remain unaltered when preferences are modified to incorporate altruistic concern for others' well-being. Altruism, however, suggests a potential role for government intervention to achieve a desirable (i.e., Pareto efficient) distribution of welfare between individuals.	Richard B. Howarth
Fairness, stewardship and sustainable development	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	The welfare economic concept of fairness offers an attractive, axiomatic foundation for the popular notion of stewardship. Fairness emphasizes the ex ante equal standing of all persons, across and within generations. This highlights the inextracability of poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, especially in the agrarian tropics where biodiversity loss, deforestation and desertification are growing global concerns.

Charging the earth: The promotion of price-based measures for pollution control	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	This paper seeks to consider the ways in which the theory and application of economic instruments, in particular price-based instruments, is shaped by the interests, values and ideologies of those who are promoting and implementing them. Although economists have been advocating the use of economic instruments for pollution control for decades, it is only in recent years that they have been embraced by business groups and governments looking for a way to avoid stricter and more costly regulations that might inhibit economic growth, and as a way of correcting, and therefore preserving the free-market system. This paper examines the rationale for price-based instruments and explains how economists have managed to enroll the support of other interest groups, even those that have conflicting interests.

Discursive ethics in ecosystems valuation and environmental policy	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	"Discursive ethics has its origin in the Frankfurt School of critical theory. As an applied ethic it is also associated with practical philosophy. In this paper discursive ethics is discussed as a conceptual and practical framework for ecosystems valuation and environmental policy. The discussion focuses on three main strengths of discursive ethics: (1) it offers an integrated process for ecosystems valuation; (2) it offers a decision-making framework for responding to uncertainty and risk and the reality of action-in-indeterminacy; (3) it offers a process for deconstructing common valuation concepts and identifying conditions for their critical reconstruction. The theoretical discussion is followed by a case study example which illustrates the usefulness of discursive ethics in identifying valuation biases hidden behind disciplinary assumptions and conceptual norms. These include cultural norms of rationality, information biases which consider ""hard facts"" over ""soft values"", and disciplinary valuation biases which distinguish between ""hard"" and ""soft"" expert contributions. As the case study illustrates, a successful application of discursive ethics in ecosystems valuation and environmental policy demands sensitivity to such underlying biases. Beyond its policy relevance discursive ethics may also offer a framework for an extended peer discourse through which new foci in research and education can be identified."	Sabine U. O'Hara

Sustainable development: looking for new strategies	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	Many strategies have been proposed to reach sustainable development. A great many of these strategies aim at one type of problem-preventing environmental deterioration-while ignoring the importance of economic or social goals. In addition, while political decisions are at the heart of the choices to be made, most researchers seem to consider sustainable development as a mere technical problem. In this paper we describe a more complete strategy for sustainable development. We use the outlines of this strategy to find out what knowledge and skills are still needed. The strategy is based on the idea that it is necessary to find consensus on the development of a socio-environmental system as a whole, and between all people involved. It leaves us with at least two main areas that need further study: the supply of information and the management of consensus building. A formal procedure for consensus building might be developed based on the literature and on experiences with Environmental Impact Assessments. Special attention is paid to the information needed. It can be summarized as information about: (1) delimiting a socio-environmental system; (2) the needs and wants to be satisfied via that system; and (3) the physical, ecological, economic, social and cultural constraints of satisfying those needs and wants.

A comparison of stated preference methods for environmental valuation	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	This paper presents an empirical comparison of contingent valuation (CVM) and choice experiments which are used to value environmental quality changes. Both of these methods require individuals to state their preferences for environmental qualities. However, choice experiments differ from CVM in that environmental attributes are varied in an experimental design which requires respondents to make repeated choices between bundles of attributes. The empirical application involved the effect of environmental quality changes arising from forest management practices on recreational moose hunting values. Significant differences were found between the values derived from the two methods. However, detailed examination of the implied choice behaviour suggested that respondents ignored substitute recreation areas in the CVM question. Restricting the choice experiment model to consider only the one site where quality was varied, resulted in welfare estimates similar to the CVM model. This highlights the importance of substitutes in environmental valuation and suggests that choice experiments may be more appropriate than CVM in some cases.	Peter C. Boxall, Wiktor L.

Cost-benefit analysis in integrated environmental assessment: some methodological issues	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	A fundamental step in integrated environmental assessment (IEA) is the choice of an assessment framework. The usual attempt to develop integrated assessments of different options is to apply a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), which is an important part of the IEA, but at the same time is one of its weakest points. One should note that this paper does not aim at presenting new advances on specific issues of CBA. The present paper has as a main objective to analyse the role of CBA in the IEA framework, in particular: (1) to make explicit the economical, philosophical and mathematical assumptions on which CBA is based; (2) to discuss the main characteristics and consequences of these assumptions; (3) to test the consistency and compatibility of such an axiomatic system. It is thought that this is useful above all for non-economists involved in IEA studies.	Giuseppe Munda
Environmental economics in poor countries: the current state and a programme for improvement	Environment and Development Economics	1996	01	01	People in poor countries are for the most part agrarian and pastoral. In 1988 rural people accounted for about 65 per cent of the population of what the World Bank classifies as low-income countries. The proportion of the total labour force in agriculture was a bit in excess of this. The share of agriculture in gross domestic product in these countries was 30 per cent. These figures should be contrasted with those from industrial market economies, which are 6 per cent and 2 per cent for the latter two ratios, respectively.	Partha Dasgupta, Karl-G√∂ran M√§ler
The environment and the ethics of discounting: An empirical analysis	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	This paper examines the application of discount rates by individuals and by governments when they make decisions about environmental resource use. The paper is presented in the context of ethics as determined by what is 'good' and also by what is 'right' for society since, in this instance, there appears to be no conflict between the two perspectives. In addition, the paper assesses whether ethical considerations are included in decision-making frameworks at the individual and community levels. Consistency of discount rate applications between individuals and governments is also investigated, since consistency is an element of ethical arguments. Empirical data from a study of soil conservation adoption by Philippines upland farmers are used in the analysis. Individual discount rates are assessed in relation to income and poverty, interest rates paid on debt, purpose of borrowings, land tenure, income inequality and soil conservation adoption. Some of the results appear to be counter-intuitive and reasons for this phenomenon are sought. The overall results have policy implications, and suggestions are made about how an ethical perspective might be developed by governments to help ensure that decision-making criteria are more consistent with the practices of individuals within the communities they serve. It is suggested that this approach would lead to greater intergenerational and intragenerational equity and better environmental quality.	Sarah Lumley
Green new world: A corporate environmental business perspective	Scandinavian Journal of Management	1996	01	01	"Interest in the relationship between business and the environment has grown significantly during the second half of the 1980s. During the 1970s and at the start of the 1980s environmental concern was mainly confined to a narrow group of environmental and political extremists. This is no longer true, however. With leading newspapers, journals, professional associations, etc., devoting more and more attention to this important relationship, the issue of environmental concern now increasingly finds its way into the boardrooms of a growing number of corporations. This paper discusses the concept of sustainable development and attempts to place it in a corporate context, not in the form of the ""ten golden rules of industrial sustainability"" but in an analysis and subsequent discussion of the way mainstream economists have handled the environment to date. Special attention is given to the interdependence between Corporate Strategic Environmental and Resource Management and Total Quality Management, and, in addition, to the importance of the measuring and controlling of environmental and resource management. Due to the fact that there appears to be only very limited industrial ""greening"" experiences in Scandinavia, this article closes with with an outline of the present situation in Denmark where this situation is beginning to change."

An agenda for the design and study of international environmental agreements	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	The combination of a general greening of international political debate, and the events of 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit have led to great interest in the question of global environmental protection. While it is recognized that international environmental agreements (IEAs) are the means by which the earth's fragile environment is most likely to be protected, this recognition has been recent. Hence there is very little formal research on the design and study of IEAs. As such, in this paper, I propose and describe a research agenda for the design and study of IEAs. Very generally, I propose that we frame the IEA design question as a problem in mechanism design. We will then be able to use, inter alia, the theory of common agency and the theory of hierarchies to generate interesting new theoretical and practical insights into the workings of IEAs.

Sustainable development principles and their implications for transport	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	Sustainable mobility' has been adopted as an overall objective for European transport policy, and similar intentions are expressed in other parts of the world. However, little has been done to define what 'sustainable mobility' would actually imply for our understanding and assessment of transport. We suspect that this much used term could merely end up acting as a lubricant to the very development it was meant to challenge: The ever increasing movement of people and goods. In this article we attempt to place transport in the context of sustainable development principles. We emphasise the need to include principles of development (increasing well-being and equity) as well as sustainability (preserving natural and man-made capital). Four such principles are suggested, taking inspiration from Herman Daly and others. We then turn to explore the main features of transport, establishing a comprehensive transport concept. The concept combines a systems perspective with a service perspective. Omitting either one would disable a complete consideration of sustainable development. Our confrontation of the four principles with the reality of current transport trends gives rise to several critical implications. The most important of which relate to the contribution of transport to depleting natural capital and quality of life. Moreover, we are also forced to challenge the value of increasing mobility itself, if other forms of access may provide relevant substitutes. The article thereby outlines some conceptual foundations for a transport policy that could qualify as sustainable.	Henrik Gudmundsson, Mattias H√∂jer
Discount rates and sustainable development	Ecological Modelling	1996	01	01	This paper explores the relationship between discounting procedures and sustainable development in environmental economics. Sustainability criteria ensure that future generations enjoy a set of life opportunities that is undiminished relative to those of the present. Cost-benefit analysis may be used to detect potential improvements in economic efficiency, which make at least some members of society better off while leaving none worse off, if discount rates are equated with market rates of interest. Cost-benefit analysis and sustainability criteria are premised on value judgements that are complementary, not mutually exclusive, in the general framework of welfare economics. The paper outlines an integrated approach to long-term natural resource and environmental management that exploits the strengths of both sets of criteria.	Richard B Howarth
Trade-related intellectual property rights to biological resources: Socioeconomic implications for developing countries	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade proposed conferring trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) to international firms on a variety of life forms and on biotechnology. This proposal has been denounced by developing countries. Many developing countries have relied heavily on indigenous biotechnology from several decades in the area of high-yielding seeds, bio-pesticides and fertilizers, herbal medicines and household consumables. This study analyzes the social, economic, and preservation implications of TRIPS for three types of biological resources: physically nonexhaustible resources, physically exhaustible resources under current use, and physically exhaustible potential future resources. The study concludes that each of these resources may require different degrees of intellectual property right (IPR) protection for their sustained use. Further, establishing IPR to products derived from genetic and biochemical resources is certainly necessary but not sufficient for biodiversity prospecting and the long-term survival of these resources. Along with the IPR protection, developing countries have to develop suitable institutions and policies, governing the use of their open-access biological resources, and enabling local communities to receive partial benefits of biodiversity conservation and prospecting.

The costs of land degradation in Sub-Saharan Africa	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	"The overriding question that this article addresses is: What are the immediate and future costs of land degradation for a nation? The objectives of the analysis are to find appropriate measures to express the national level costs of land degradation, and suitable methods to estimate such measures. Furthermore, the aim is to document and interpret the results of existing studies. To meet these objectives, a set of 12 studies from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is reviewed, using a consistent, cross-study analytical framework derived from the objectives above. With regard to measures of the cost of land degradation, this article identifies ten different dimensions, which illustrate the importance of qualifying statements about ""the costs of land degradation"" by rigorous clarification of what type of measure has been used. Furthermore, with regard to methods of deriving costs of land degradation, this article illustrates a spectrum of approaches. One sub-group has used a replacement cost approach, while a productivity loss approach has been used in the majority of the studies reviewed. The latter approach is further sub-divided into five different categories ranging from the most informal to the most rigorous. It is evident that very few original estimates exist of soil loss yield decline functions in Sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, some of the basic work in this area is ""recycled"" for use in areas that may exhibit quite different conditions. Finally, with regard to study results, there is considerable variance of cost estimates pertaining even to the same country. These differences can be explained, however, and a rational assessment allows a choice of the most appropriate results. Results across countries are reasonably well clustered in terms of their productivity impact per soil loss unit. With local knowledge of soil conditions, but in the absence of local yield loss data, this provides a useful interval of reasonable assumptions. As one would expect, the national costs of land degradation vary considerably across countries. This sometimes leaves room for considerable investment in soil and water conservation, but should not invoke images of a rapidly approaching doomsday."	Jan Boj√∂
Non-transboundary pollution and the efficiency of international environmental co-operation	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	The standard view is that situations where no transborder environmental externalities occur are most efficiently dealt with by national environmental policies rather than by international co-operation. Though this may be the general case, non-coordinated national policies do not always produce the most efficient international allocation. This paper presents four cases in which the allocative outcome of non-coordinated domestic policy choices can be improved upon by international environmental co-operation. The first case refers to the use of environmental policy as a strategic trade instrument. The other cases refer to the existence of discrete technologies, set-up costs and increasing returns to scale. The form of international environmental co-operation should be adapted to the situation. Formal international agreements between countries are characterised by high transaction costs and may not always be the most efficient form of co-operation.	Henk L.M. Kox, Casper M. Van der Tak
The concept of weak sustainability	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	This paper surveys the links between growth theory with exhaustible resources and the concept of weak sustainability.

On sustainability; the environment and management accounting	Management Accounting Research	1996	01	01	Following a review of the content of classic management accounting texts and the accounting research literature, this paper concludes that corporate accounting in general, and management accounting in particular, have ignored a wide range of non-market activities that are associated with private sector organizations and their impact on the biophysical environment. The formal decision analysis invoked in traditional management accounting neglects the social cost and benefits of corporate activities. Integrating environmental concerns into accounting will come in part from focusing on developments in other disciplines, particularly the natural and social sciences, which have a much longer history of analysing environmental problems. In this paper an analysis of the concept of sustainability and its relationships with decision-making is used to illustrate the multidisciplinary issues that are often involved when considering the environment. Such an analysis points towards additional developments for management decision-making and education, for example, social cost-benefit analysis and non-market valuation techniques. At the same time, this analysis also raises the issue of the scale of economic activity in relation to ecosystem capacity, and challenges some conventional wisdom, such as the practice of project analysis. The paper introduces a framework of analytical approaches to environmental resources within which to view existing and future accounting developments.	Markus J. Milne
Multicriteria decision analysis and environmental economics: An approximation	European Journal of Operational Research	1996	01	01	A multicriteria approach to address basic problems in environmental economics is proposed in this paper. The methodology is underpinned by the wellknown multicriteria method called Compromise Programming together with some recent results relating the compromise sets with the traditional optimisation of the utility functions. To illustrate the proposed methodology the following two cases are suggested: (1) The reconciliation between economic, environmental as well as recreational objectives inherent to the management of an environmental asset such as forestry system, and (2) Its application to the appraisal of environmental improvements or damages when nonmonetary objectives are involved.	Carlos Romero
Environmental accounting: useful to whom and for what?	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	The development of statistics, as with any other tool, can only be understood in relation to their particular uses. This is confirmed by the development of National Income estimates and of the National Accounts. Proposals to integrate environmental costs and benefits into the National Accounts can similarly only be evaluated by considering them in the context of their likely policy use. The most important potential use is as a general measure of welfare or progress, for policy to aim to maximise. Environmentally adjusted National Accounts correspond to a very weak view of sustainability. The use of adjusted National Income as a measure of welfare essentially assumes complete substitutability between manufactured and natural capital. Problems of monetary valuation are likely to lead to huge underestimation of environmental costs. Issues of inequality and poverty, essential to a more robust view of sustainability, are ignored. Policy targeting a revised National Income will continue to aim for ever higher output while making very limited concessions to environmental concerns. Adjusting the National Accounts for environmental costs is not the only way to ensure they are allowed for in policy making. An alternative approach, more appropriate if sustainable development in the stronger sense is to be achieved, is the construction and use of a set of social and environmental indicators.	John Lintott

Revisiting carrying capacity: Area-based indicators of sustainability	Population and Environment	1996	01	01	"Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that because of technology and trade, human carrying capacity is infinitely expandable and therefore virtually irrelevant to demography and development planning. By contrast, this article argues that ecological carrying capacity remains the fundamental basis for demographic accounting. A fundamental question for ecological economics is whether remaining stocks of natural capital are adequate to sustain the anticipated load of the human economy into the next century. Since mainstream (neoclassical) models are blind to ecological structure and function, they cannot even properly address this question. The present article therefore assesses the capital stocks, physical flows, and corresponding ecosystems areas required to support the economy using ""ecological footprint"" analysis. This approach shows that most so-called ""advanced"" countries are running massive unaccounted ecological deficits with the rest of the planet. Since not all countries can be net importers of carrying capacity, the material standards of the wealthy cannot be extended sustainably to even the present world population using prevailing technology. In this light, sustainability may well depend on such measures as greater emphasis on equity in international relationships, significant adjustments to prevailing terms of trade, increasing regional self-reliance, and policies to stimulate a massive increase in the material and energy efficiency of economic activity."

Is the income elasticity of environmental improvements less than one?	Environmental and Resource Economics	1996	01	01	Abstract: We estimated the income elasticity of environmental improvements for a number of European data-sets. The value of this parameter is consistently found to be less than one, with few exceptions. Our findings are compared with state-of-the-art contingent valuation studies from other countries. We also compared our findings with those reported in the literature on charitable donations and corporate donations. These studies show a similar pattern; donations decrease as a percentage of income, as income increases.	Bengt Kristrom, Pere Riera

Exhaustible resources and sustainable development	Resources Policy	1996	01	01	Though sustainable development is a relatively recent addition to the public lexicon, concern that resource depletion may threaten the welfare of future generations dates back at least to Thomas Malthus and other classical economists writing nearly two centuries ago. Today the debate over this threat not only continues, but seems more polarized than ever. In one school are the concerned, often ecologists and other scientists and engineers, who contend the earth cannot for long continue to support current and anticipated levels of demand for oil and other exhaustible resources. In the opposing school are the unconcerned, often economists, who claim with equal conviction that the earth with the help of market incentives, appropriate public policies, and new technology can amply provide for society's needs for the indefinite future. That intelligent and informed individuals remain so divided on such an important issue for the future of humanity after years of debate is surprising. The explanation, at least in part, appears to lie with the very different paradigms adopted by the two different groups coupled with quite contrasting views on the beneficence of technology, public policy and the marketplace. The two competing paradigms lead to quite different outlooks on the human condition and in turn on recommendations for public policy.	John E. Tilton
The stork, the plow, rural social structure and tropical deforestation in poor countries?	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	Several authoritative sources attribute deforestation in poor countries to the actions of the rural poor. Others argue that this is tantamount to blaming the victim and directing attention away from the fundamental causes-inequality in landholding, tenure insecurity and landlessness-of deforestation. Unfortunately, there are no statistical tests of the impact of these rural political economy variables on deforestation. This paper uses a model of deforestation based on rural household labor allocation decisions to empirically assess how those decisions interact with the structure of rural political economy to determine the extent of deforestation in poor countries. Cross-country multiple regression equations suggest that policies to intensify smallholder agriculture can slow population movement to the agricultural frontier. But regression results also show that this outcome depends on the degree of equality in the distribution of landholdings and the extent of rural rootlessness. These findings have two important implications for public policy. First, they suggest that efforts to slow deforestation must start with an understanding of the behavior of the millions of small farmers who now deforest. Second, they suggest that political economy interpretations of deforestation need to taken more seriously by those trying to conserve forested areas.	Michael T. Rock
Measuring sustainable development: progress on indicators	Environment and Development Economics	1996	01	01	The search for sustainability indicators should be guided by a theory of sustainable development (SD). In this paper we investigate two such theoretical frameworks and the indicators that they suggest. Indicators associated with weak sustainability are characterized by aggregative indicators such as green national income. We conclude, however, that a more promising offshoot of green accounting is measures of genuine savings (i.e. savings adjusted for loss of assets). To achieve SD, genuine savings rates must not be persistently negative. Strong sustainability indicators accord a more central role to the conservation of critical natural assets within the broader goal of prudently managing a nation's portfolio of assets over time. We discuss two approaches-carrying capacity and resilience-and conclude that, while measures of resilience are potentially attractive, more research is required regarding the resilience-SD link. However, an important conclusion that we can make is that, even in an economy operating under a strong sustainability regime, genuine savings are still key indicators of SD and are complementary to measures of changes in stocks of critical natural assets.

Ecological engineering: First steps towards economic analysis	Ecological Engineering	1996	01	01	Ecosystems fulfill a large number of ecological and economic functions. Increasing economic activity and population pressure are threatening the quality of ecosystems, and strengthen the need for ecological engineering. In this article some of the economic aspects of ecological engineering are discussed. In particular, the various methods to establish the economic costs and benefits of ecological engineering. For benefit estimation various methods are developed, including the contingent valuation method, the hedonic pricing method, the travel cost method and the shadow project method. The economic background, and the applicability and appropriateness of these methods are discussed. Next, the results of several studies on wetland valuation are shortly presented. It is concluded that the full socio-economic assessment of ecological engineering is still to be developed, and that further cooperation between ecologists and economists is required to make progress in this field that is rapidly gaining importance in policy making, both at the European and the global level.

Economic growth and environmental degradation: The environmental Kuznets curve and sustainable development	World Development	1996	01	01	In this paper we critically examine the concept of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). It proposes that there is an inverted U-shape relation between environmental degradation and income per capita, so that, eventually, growth reduces the environmental impact of economic activity. The concept is dependent on a model of the economy in which there is no feedback from the quality of the environment to production possibilities, and in which trade has a neutral effect on environmental degradation. The actual violation of these assumptions gives rise to fundamental problems in estimating the parameters of an EKC. The paper identifies other econometric problems with estimates of the EKC, and reviews a number of empirical studies. The inference from some such EKC estimates that further development will reduce environmental degradation is dependent on the assumption that world per capita income is normally distributed when in fact median income is far below mean income. We carry out simulations combining EKC estimates from the literature with World Bank forecasts for economic growth for individual countries, aggregating over countries to derive the global impact. Within the horizon of the Bank's forecast (2025) global emissions of SO2 continue to increase. Forest loss stabilizes before the end of the period but tropical deforestation continues at a constant rate throughout the period.	David I. Stern, Michael S. Common, Edward B. Barbier
Economics, ecology and entropy: The second law of thermodynamics and the limits to growth	Population and Environment	1996	01	01	Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics has played an important role in ecological economics as providing a justification for the view that economies have limits to growth. Yet beyond basic textbooks statements of this law, we seldom find informed philosophical examinations of the meaning and metaphysical justification for the second law. In this paper we shall examine some challenges which have been made to the limits to growth (Limitationist) position by those criticizing the scope and application of the second law of thermodynamics and we shall in turn defend Limitationism against these criticisms.

CAPITALIZING AND APPROPRIATING SOCIETY'S RIGHTS TO CLEAN AIR: A COMMENT ON WAMBSGANSS & SANFORD'S ACCOUNTING PROPOSAL	Critical Perspectives on Accounting	1996	01	01	Wambsganss and Sanford propose that utilities capitalise sulfur dioxide emission permits gifted to them by the Environmental Protection Agency. This commentary critically rejects such a proposal. Wambsganss and Sanford's proposal relies on unacceptably narrow assumptions that utilities and their shareholders own rights to pollute and that economic efficiency should be the sole arbiter in determining the regulation of environmental resources. By a brief historical analysis of the U.S. emissions regulations, such assumptions are shown to be both invalid, and, in fact, potentially self-defeating.	MARKUS J. MILNE
Discounting and distributional considerations in the context of global warming	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	The economics of global warming is reviewed with special emphasis on how the cost depends on the discount rate and on how costs in poor and rich regions are aggregated into a global cost estimate. Both of these factors depend on the assumptions made concerning the underlying utility and welfare functions. It is common to aggregate welfare gains and losses across generations and countries as if the utility of money were constant, but it is not. If we assume that a e CO2-equivalent dlubling implies costs equal to 1.5% of the income in both high and low income countries, a pure rate of time preference equal to zero, and a utility function which is logarithmic in income, then the marginal cost of CO2 emissions is estimated at 260-590 USD/ton C for a time horizon in the range 300-1000 years, an estimate which is large enough to justify significant reductions of CO2 emissions on purely economic grounds. The estimate is approximately 50-100-times larger than the estimate made by Nordhaus in his DICE model and the difference is almost completely due to the choice of discount rate and the weight given to the costs in the developing world as well as a more accurate model of the carbon cycle. Finally, the sensitivity of the marginal cost estimate with respect to several parameters is analyzed.	Christian Azar, Thomas Sterner

If tropical log export bans are so perverse, why are there so many?	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	A substantial number of tropical timber-owning nations have enacted bans or similar provisions constraining the export of crude logs. Job creation, capturing value-added, and improving the efficiency of domestic processing are often given as reasons for such bans. However, neoclassical economics finds such bans uneconomic, and development agencies often support their repeal. This paper examines this contradiction and offers reasons why: (a) log export bans are defensible in certain realistic circumstances and (b) certain theoretical arguments against log export bans often lack relevance.

Regional pollution and multinational firms	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	This paper investigates the incidence of pollution control in a two-country, two good model of trade and investment when capital is internationally mobile. In this context, we show the trade-off between the regulation of pollution and national income in the host country and the interrelationship between policies pursued in the host country and the economy of the source country. One noteworthy result is that more restrictive pollution controls in the host country may cause a decline in the real income of the source country, the home of multinational firms.

Forms of capital and intrinsic values	Chemosphere	1996	01	01	The thrust of much work in ecological economics has been to develop better means of identifying and quantifying aspects of the environment which have instrumental or resource value. Less attention has been paid to quantifying environmental and social phenomena that have intrinsic value. Indeed, some economists would argue that intrinsic value does not exist. Yet many environmental issues arise in the first place because of strongly felt concern about the threat to intrinsic values and the need to make these sacred. In New Zealand, environmental legislation explicity requires that the state of intrinsically valued environmental capital be monitored and included in environmental decisions. A problem for those of us trying to develop ESSD indicators is that intrinsic values seem vague and ad hoc with no clear relation to other forms of capital and no unambiguous define criteria. This paper provides a clear defining criterion and propose a taxonomy of capital that incorporates both instrumental and intrinsic values.	Rowan Taylor

A CONTINGENT VALUATION STUDY OF UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL GAINS	Scottish Journal of Political Economy	1996	01	01	Acid deposition in a present and future cause of biodiversity losses in vulnerable upland areas of Scotland important for nature conservation. However, the exact nature of damages under the status quo, and both the timing and extent of recovery of upland ecosystems if deposition is reduced, are subject to uncertainty. this uncertainty complicates damages cost estimation. In this paper, we have explored the use of CVM to measure the willingness to pay (WTP) of the Scottish population for uncertain recovery/damage scenarios from reduced acid rain deposition. An optimally-designed referendum format was used utilising the distribution of open-ended bids from a pilot study to determine bid amounts and sampling size for each bid amount. Eight explanatory variables, including future damage level were selected in a non-linear step-wise regression analysis. Average household WTP for abatement of acid rain was ¬£247 and ¬£351 per year when faced with low and high future damage levels respectively. Recovery level and recovery time did not significantly influence WTP. When faced with risky outcomes regarding future damage and recovery level, respondent were found to be risk averse to both environmental gains and losses.

Evolutionary economics at the crossroads of biology and physics	Journal of Social and Evolutionary Systems	1996	01	01	For almost a century, evolutionary economics has been based to a significant extent on analogies derived from biology. At the same time, the discipline suffered from lack of analytical rigor. Recently, advances in thermodynamics and information theory have provided a new foundation for evolutionary studies in biology and economics alike. As a result, the body of studies in evolutionary economics that imports concepts from thermodynamics and information theory to develop new analogies is growing. This paper surveys recent trends in evolutionary economics at the crossroads of biology and physics, and argues to supplant analogies derived from either of the two disciplines. Albeit powerful means to crystallize thought about evolutionary processes in economic systems, analogies from biology have tended to plaster over the many differences between biological and economic processes that are essential to economic systems. Similarly, thermodynamics and information theory cannot provide a non-anthropocentric evaluation of economic processes. Yet, the concepts and measures available from physics can be used to improve our understanding of economic evolution if properly placed into the context of socioeconomic processes. The article delineates the realm for non-analogy-based applications of concepts from physics for the assessment of economic processes in light of discontinuities and emergent complexities.

Application of LCA in German industry	The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment	1996	01	01	Abstract: This article summarises the findings of a survey on the application of LCA in German industry. It elaborates on the objectives and the considered products of LCAs in different industrial branches. Positively answered questionnaires have primarily been received from the automobile industry, followed by the chemical and paper and print industries. In general, German industry has become more experienced with LCA and will continue to apply this instrument in the near future. The evaluation reveals that the prevailing objective is product and process optimisation, while the utilisation for procurement, for example, is not yet wide spread. Furthermore, LCA is used for information purposes, while the major target groups are customers and consumers. Companies, however, especially those in the automobile industry, do not always make these studies available to the public. It appears that food companies use LCAs in a more offensive fashion, while chemical industry applies these instruments for more defensive reasons. Few LCAs have been conducted by industrial associations. For them, they more often serve external purposes, i.e. information of interest groups is more important than product optimisation.

Statistical measures of unsustainability	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	"Statistical measures are needed to reveal at a glance how far (or near) various countries are to meeting the conditions of long-run sustainability, and how conditions are changing on a year-to-year basis (i.e., whether sustainability is being approached or not). The scheme proposed in this paper presents numerical comparisons of energy and materials use in the real world vis a vis an ideal case where all of the identifiable criteria for sustainability are satisfied. Apart from population stabilization, five general but quantifiable criteria for sustainability are suggested, including (1) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, (2) stabilization of acidity (pH) in rainfall, (3) reduction of dissipative uses, and wastes, of heavy metals to natural mobilization rates, or lower, (4) elimination of agriculture based on pumping ""fossil"" water from non-renewable aquifers and (5) elimination of loss of arable land because of salination or erosion. Other criteria, such as preservation of biodiversity and socio-economic equity between countries and generations might be added to the list. They introduce more difficult measurement problems, however, which are not considered further in the paper. Having fixed the list of criteria, the next step is to identify measures that either go to zero or unity, as the system approaches more and more closely to sustainability, at least in the limited sense defined above. Various types of measures of sustainability/unsustainability can be developed, viz. (i) measures of relative dependence of the economy on non-renewable sources of energy and materials, (ii) measures of the productivity of energy and materials consumed by the economic system and (iii) measures of dissipative loss, especially of toxic and hazardous substances. Specific examples of each type are discussed."	Robert U. Ayres
The impact of environmental policies on household incomes for different socio-economic classes: The case of air pollutants in Indonesia	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	With outdoor air pollutants in Indonesia as a case study, this paper expands a Social Accounting Matrix to include the link from the economy to the environment, as well as the link from the environment to the economy. This paper explores the relationship between production activities, pollution, and human health problems. It utilizes the Constrained Fixed Price Multipliers method to analyze the impact of policies designed to reduce the amount of pollutants in the air on household incomes for different socio-economic classes in Indonesia. The results show that if policies designed to reduce the amount of pollutants in the air do not decrease the output of production sectors, then the policies also improve income distribution.	Budy P.

The Implications of the Nonlinear Paradigm for Integrated Environmental Design and Planning	Journal of Planning Literature	1996	01	01	"The purpose of this article is to describe the potential implications of the ""new sciences"" such as chaos theory, self-organization theory, and complexity science to reconcile various different schools of philosophical thought in the environment development debate. Design, through the means of transdisciplinary analysis, here is conceived as a creative process that aids in the emergence of appropriate metaphors and models for the development of sophisticated environmental planning and policies. The epistemological and philosophical foundations of two broad paradigms of thought, the material and ecological paradigms, are examined to develop a more comprehensive approach to sustainable development. Surprisingly, this takes us into the terrain of Newtonian mechanics and principles of thermodynamics. The article then presents an alternative view of sustainability based on the emerging new science paradigm. Finally, the article examines some possible implicationsfor integrated environmental design and planning."	Sang W. Hwang

The economics of the environment	Environment and Development Economics	1996	01	01	This article offers an account of the economics of the environment. I sketch the subject's motivation and scope, and try to identify what we know and what we don't as yet know about matters of concern. This demands brazen selection, and I haven't avoided it: for the most part, the article explores the interface of rural poverty and the environmental resource-base in poor countries. A contrast is drawn between geographically localized resources and the global commons. The role of property rights, both private and collective, and their implied resource allocation mechanisms are studied. Criteria for social cost-benefit analysis of projects and policies are derived, and their link with the concept of net national product is drawn.	Partha Dasgupta
"How can a ""competitive"" market for electricity be made compatible with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions?"	Ecological Economics	1996	01	01	"Under what conditions can the creation of a competitive market for electricity allow the efficient use of energy to compete on an equal basis with electricity supply, thus providing both economic benefits to consumers and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions? In this paper the current micro-economic ""reforms"" to the Australian electricity industry are taken as a case study to investigate this question. It is found that the proposed ""competitive"" market for electricity contains barriers to the wider implementation of efficient energy use and renewable energy which are additional to those already existing in a highly regulated market. In order to allow efficient energy use to compete on an equal basis with electricity supply, it is necessary to create a market for energy services, not electricity, at the retail level. To do this requires institutional changes. Correct pricing is not sufficient."	Mark Diesendorf
Ecological-economic modelling of the conservation of threatened habitats: heather moorland in the Northern Isles of Scotland	Biodiversity & Conservation	1996	01	01	: This paper describes the results of an ecological-economic modelling exercise of the management of a scarce habitat, namely heather moorland. The Orkney Islands of Scotland are used to illustrate a modelling approach which could be easily applied elsewhere, and to other habitats. We describe the evolution and present condition of heather moorland on Orkney, then quantify the extent of over-grazing (leading to ecological damage) on a spatial basis. This is accomplished using a model of heather utilization and heather productivity. Critical grazing limits are then used as constraints in an economic model of farm production decisions, which enables us to quantify the minimum necessary compensation payments which farmers should be offered to offset income losses due to grazing restrictions. Such a policy is in line with European Union and UK agri-environmental policy, which typically uses payments for income forgone as a means of persuading farmers to protect environmental quality.

Sustainable Marketing	Journal of Macromarketing	1996	01	01	"In order for marketing to play a role in sustainable economic development, a critical reassessment of marketing theory is required. Both the ""societal marketing"" of the 1970s and contemporary ""green marketing"" are efforts to improve the relationship between marketing and the natural environment. Taken alone, however, either approach provides but a partial analysis of the problems that are involved. Starting from the assumptions and limitations of economic and cognitive approaches to marketing and from the dilemmas between micro-marketing objectives and macromarketing goals, marketing is shown to have an inherent drive toward unsustainability. Sustainable marketing requires finding optimal regulatory frameworks for governing the role of marketing within a confined ecological space."	Ynte K. van Dam, Paul A. C. Apeldoorn
Environmental equity and sustainability: rejecting the Kaldor-Hicks criteria	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	An implementable translation of environmental equity and sustainability is provided for use in benefit-cost analysis. As such, the approach builds on the underlying economic structure of benefit-cost analysis while trying to cause it to evolve in ways that take into account issues of greater concern to ecological economists. Environmental equity and sustainability are interpreted as imposing new decision criteria that require additional benefit-cost tests based on actual compensation to identified sub-groups of the population. This rejects the pre World War II compromise of economists regarding potential compensation embodied in the Kaldor-Hicks criteria. For environmental equity, a project is proposed to pass a benefit-cost test if the identified group either receives net benefits or is more than compensated for its losses. For sustainability, a project is proposed to pass a benefit-cost test if the compensation is larger than the net value of the resource, and the net value of the resource is reinvested.	Scott Farrow
Developments in the throughput-income relationship: theoretical and empirical observations	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	It has been suggested that the relationship between income and the associated environmental pressure in terms of derived materials inputs and pollution levels may take an inverted-U shape, indicating a 'delinking' of environmental pressure from economic growth in relation to rising per capita incomes. The likelihood of such a relationship being persistent is discussed in the context of a simple macro model of industrial metabolism, and the possibility of 'relinking' clearly emerges. Data on specific indicators of environmental pressure (i.e., the throughput of materials, energy and the volume of transport) in 19 countries have been used to investigate patterns of delinking. The results suggest that delinking may not be persistent; already some advanced economies may be entering a new period of relinking. The relationships between environmental pressure and welfare in the medium long term may be N-shaped rather than inverted-U-shaped.	S.M. de Bruyn, J.B. Opschoor
A joint investigation of public support and public values: case of instream flows in New Mexico	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Instream flow can be defined as the flow of water in its natural channels without diversion. Alone among the western US states, New Mexico (NM) fails to provide any mechanism for the protection of instream flows and has a long history of political resistance to any change in the status quo. Using the combined results from two statewide telephone surveys, this study jointly investigates stated voting preferences for a proposed institutional change and stated valuation preferences for minimum instream flow protection. The contingent valuation (CV) question uses a dichotomous choice (DC) elicitation format and a voluntary contribution trust fund payment vehicle. Results show a highly significant positive correlation between expressed voting preferences and expressed valuation preferences. Additionally, those individuals who respond YES to the voting question have an expected willingness to pay (WTP) of $80 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) that is always positive ($62-97), while those who respond NO to the voting question, have an expected WTP that is actually slightly negative (-$6) with a 95% CI containing zero (-$14-2). Taken together, these results provide evidence of construct validity. Estimation results are also shown to be temporally reliable across repeated samples. Thus, there is strong evidence of public support for instream flow protection and its associated nonmarket benefits. Such evidence helps to provide instream flow concerns with standing in future NM water policy debates. Prominent examples include explicitly defining 'beneficial use' and 'public welfare' to allow consideration of instream flow protection.	Robert P. Berrens, Alok K.

A dynamic, hierarchical approach to understanding and managing natural economic systems	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	The study of economic systems, and their guidance towards sustainability, can be enhanced by understanding how natural systems use materials and energy at various levels of system organization, how these levels interrelate, and how interrelationships change. Towards this end, the paper introduces natural economics as an approach to understanding the dynamics of hierarchical systems. We define the concepts of natural economics to facilitate the description and assessment of system change, and present dynamic modeling as a method for empirical research and as a tool for management decision making. We illustrate with empirical applications the use of dynamic modeling at various levels of system organization. Empirical illustrations range from dynamic models of simple physical systems of material transport, energy degradation and self-organized criticality to models of complex industrial systems, such as US iron ore mining and steel production. The insights derived from the natural economics approach are used to draw conclusions for the study and management of economy-environment interactions.	Roy F. Weston, Matthias Ruth

Limits to substitution and irreversibility in production and consumption: A neoclassical interpretation of ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	"There are many methodological approaches within ecological economics. One of the principal modes of analysis is a modified version of the 'standard neoclassical model'. This paper examines the parallels which emerge between the ideas of some ecological economists concerning production and the ideas of others concerning consumption, when these ideas are interpreted in the neoclassical paradigm. It is well known that ecological economics is characterized by arguments concerning limits to substitution between inputs (energy, natural capital, etc., vs. manufactured capital, labor, etc.) in production and the implications these have for sustainability. However, various authors have also expressed concerns regarding limits to substitution in consumption, either between environmental assets and other goods or between basic needs commodities and other goods. Though the specific reasons for non-substitution are different in the production and consumption cases, the underlying theme is that individual commodities and other inputs have unique physical or other properties which make them poor substitutes. Ideas about irreversibility in production and economic development are also prominent in ecological economics. Likewise, many authors have argued for similar irreversibilities in consumption behavior. In analogy to the term technological change, I coin the term ""preferential change"" to describe these phenomena. The linking themes in this case are that the economy-environment system is evolutionary in character and that external effects-intended and unintended consequences of actions or processes imposed on other parties or resources-are all pervasive."

A reexamination of the role of thermodynamics for environmental economics	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	As the discussion about the role of thermodynamics in environmental economics has not led to a conclusion yet, a more fundamental approach seems to be necessary which also takes into consideration the relationship between economics and the natural sciences in general. To this end value theory is chosen as a starting point because it is the centerpiece of every economic theory. It is shown that neoclassical environmental economics suffers from serious deficiencies because of its value concept heedlessly copied from classical mechanics. Thermodynamics can be expected to be helpful to redress these defects because the economy can be thought of as a dissipative structure dependent on its environment. The obvious way to integrate thermodynamics consists in the formulation of thermodynamic constraints to complement neoclassical environmental economics. But this approach remains unsatisfactory because the neoclassical mechanical hardcore is incompatible with the entropy law and its implications. Evidently, the neoclassical paradigm and its value concept have to be given up. But the alternative of the energy theory of value must be rejected because its determinism cannot be reconciled with the richness of human behaviour. As thermodynamic analogies offer no solution either, there is a dilemma between the necessity and the apparent impossibility of adequately integrating thermodynamic concepts. It turns out that a normative inconsistency is responsible which is due to the demand for intergenerational justice. Therefore, the integration of thermodynamics into environmental economics hinges on a meta-economic value decision. If sustainability is adopted as the guiding principle, the insights of thermodynamics call for a macro-economic environmental policy setting absolute limits to the economy. But this macro policy is incompatible with neoclassical economics so that a social reconstruction of economics, based on a social theory of value, becomes necessary. In sum, thermodynamics is important for environmental economics: besides fulfilling a general heuristic function, it also fulfils a decisive conceptual and an analytical function insofar as it helps to justify sustainability and to operationalize macro-economic environmental policy.

Evolutionary strategies in environmental policy	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Many of today's environmental problems can be attributed to a difference in the development of ecological and economic systems. Both kinds of systems develop over time, but so far they have followed different organizational principles with respect to the basic factors energy, matter, information, space and time. The types of environmental problems encountered pose particular difficulties because of the different temporal and spatial characteristics of markets and ecosystems. In the long run, cultural evolution, and hence economic development, cannot progress without considering fundamental laws and principles of nature. Equilibrium oriented concepts in environmental economics aiming at the internalization of externalities do not offer adequate solutions to these problems. Policy approaches favouring environmental standards, based on current knowledge and technology, equally are of little help: either the knowledge of complex interactions in natural systems is missing to exactly determine precise standards, or past and continuing processes, often time-delayed, make them obsolete. Chronic and pervasive environmental problems call for an enhancement of environmental policy that encompasses a process orientation while considering ecological principles of system development. Evolutionary strategies increasingly have to adapt economic patterns of development to ecological patterns of development. Environmental policy goals and corresponding instruments can be designed to continuously set signals for long-term structural change. The basic factor, energy, will be used to illustrate evolutionary strategies regarding direct and indirect effects. An analysis of the Scandinavian experience with carbon and energy taxes exemplifies first successful steps at implementation.	Irene Ring

An ecological economic approach to forest and biodiversity conservation: The case of vanuatu	World Development	1997	01	01	The paper presents an ecological economic approach to forest and biodiversity conservation. Constructivist philosophy of social science is critically reviewed and adopted as the methodological basis of the approach. The paradigmatic basis of ecological economics is discussed and a model of human behavior suited to ecological economics is presented. This model accounts for altruistic, normative/affective, and irrational behavior, as well as the role of institutions. A discussion of participatory land use planning, which also accounts for intergenerational equity issues, completes the presentation of the ecological economic approach. Its application to the conservation of forests and biodiversity in Vanuatu demonstrates the operational applicability of the proposed approach.	Luca Tacconi
On the option value of old-growth forest	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	The option value of an old-growth forest is determined when the net value of timber is known and non-timber amenity value evolves according to geometric Brownian motion. The model permits the derivation of a critical barrier or boundary on amenity value, denoted A*. Specifically, A* is the minimum amenity value necessary to justify continued preservation. The model is applied to the Headwaters Forest, the last privately-owned stand of old-growth coast redwood, containing timber with a net value between $500 and $600 million. Estimates of the mean drift and variance rates for the amenity value of the headwaters are obtained under the assumption that amenity value is proportional to the visitation rate at the Redwood National Park (50 miles north of the Headwaters Forest). For base-case parameters, the amenity value of the Headwaters must exceed $5.008 million per year to justify continued preservation.	Jon M Conrad
New advances in economic modelling and evaluation of environmental issues	European Journal of Operational Research	1997	01	01	This paper gives an overview of recent progress made in modelling economic environmental systems and in environmental policy analysis. In the modelling part attention will be given to new integrating frameworks offered inter alia by materials balance approaches, especially in the context of linkages between physical environmental phenomena and economic production and valuation. These can be relevant for studying materials-product chains, multisectoral materials flows, or even multiple use of complex ecosystems. Modern approaches will be dealt with, such as analysis for sustainable development, and ways of incorporating scenario experiments in environmental modelling approaches. In the context of sustainable development, modelling of multiple use of ecosystems and of spatial dimensions is also discussed. In the last part of the paper new advances in the area of environmental policy analysis will be dealt with. The main focus will be on methods for addressing uncertainty in evaluating environmental policy strategies, in particular fuzzy information and the use of meta-analysis.

Applying socio-ecological economics: A case study of contingent valuation and integrated catchment management	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Socio-ecological economics has emerged as a new movement within ecological economics that overtly takes account of the sociological and political bases of economic activity as well as the biophysical base. The paper comments on the usefulness of the principles of socio-ecological economics in the light of a recent example of applied social and economic research into contingent valuation (CV) and integrated catchment management (ICM) in the Hawkesbury-Nepean. In the first Australian study of the temporal stability of CV responses, it was found that average willingness to pay (WTP) to improve water quality did not change significantly over a 2-year period, nor could any statistically significant explanation of bid size or change in WTP be found. On each of the three occasions when CV surveys were completed, participants were asked a series of follow-up questions and then engaged in discussion on attitudes to CV, reasons for any changes in WTP and views of possible uses for CV in ICM. Socio-ecological economics proved to be useful in analysing the results of the case study by identifying a wider range of possible determinants of individual and government behaviour than simple maximisation models. These determinants, especially ethical values for individuals and organisational culture for governments provided good explanations for the qualitative results obtained, and perhaps a better explanation of the quantitative results. It also usefully emphasised the dynamics of the interaction between the different determinants of behaviour with regard to CV. Consideration of the likely dynamic between the different organisational structures and cultures within ICM raised the possibility that introducing CV into ICM in a widespread fashion could lead to resistance and modification of its use to a more qualitative and educative role. The ideas of socio-ecological economics have made a valuable contribution to the understanding and analysis of this case study and provide the beginning of a research agenda for socially-oriented ecological economists. Results of the case study suggest that this agenda should include the applications of learning theory and social ecology to policy-making institutions and processes for moving towards sustainability.

Economic benefits of maintaining ecological integrity of R√≠o Mameyes, in Puerto Rico	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	A contingent valuation in-person survey of Puerto Rican households was performed to estimate their willingness to pay for preserving instream flows in the R√≠o Mameyes and avoiding a dam on the R√≠o Fajardo. Households annual willingness-to-pay amount was $27 for the R√≠o Mameyes and $28 for the R√≠o Fajardo. When expanded to the one million households in Puerto Rico on an annual basis this amounts to $11.33 million for the R√≠o Mameyes and $13.09 million for the R√≠o Fajardo. The household values can be compared to the costs of repairing water lines and in-home water conservation measures to determine whether there are more net benefits to these alternative sources of water than withdrawals from the Rio Mameyes.

Biodiversity, resilience and the control of ecological-economic systems: the case of fire-driven rangelands	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	The loss of resilience in systems characterised by multiple equilibria is indicated by a discontinuous change in the state of the system, or the transition from one locally stable state corresponding to a particular mix of species to another state corresponding to a different mix of species. The resilience of the system (the state of the range in this example) may be influenced by the management regime through its impact on the response to disturbances. The paper shows that optimal management of an event-driven system should be sensitive to the opportunities created by such events.	Charles Perrings, Brian Walker

Environmental pollution and world trade	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	In this paper we present a model that highlights the relationship between international trade and environmental pollution. It includes a small open economy that produces a domestic composite good and imports another composite good and energy products. The pollution is created by local production, global production and transportation. Given this model we demonstrate that free trade within the current political and economic context may produce a suboptimal level of welfare. The rationale is based upon the argument that transportation is energy-intensive and that, therefore, trade itself is a source of pollution. Consequently, under certain global conditions the introduction of an energy tariff in a small open economy raises social welfare and is superior to free trade. A consumption tariff adopted by a single nation will not have similar consequences because it has no impact upon local usage. However, when a consumption tariff is globally adopted there is the opportunity for a net benefit. Finally, we argue that a global tariff that raises both the price of energy and the price of the imported composite good may generate the greatest increase in welfare by reducing both energy-intensive production and energy-intensive trade.

An overlapping generations model with exhaustible resources and stock pollution	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	This paper analyzes the nexus between resource exhaustion and pollution externality using an overlapping generations framework where each generation lives only for a finite period. For a finite horizon model with production where there are many agents per generation, the Pareto inefficiency arises due to lack of intragenerational coordination and is propagated across generations. The tax rates necessary for correcting this externality are characterized. We also derive a modified Hotelling rule according to which the equilibrium resource price rises slower than the rate of interest in order to account for the damages due to the pollution stock generated by the resource used. For the case where the externality induced damage acts on production rather than the utility function, Pareto inefficiency is shown to persist even when there is intragenerational coordination.	P.

REAL AND HYPOTHETICAL WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESERVATION: A NON-EXPERIMENTAL COMPARISON	Journal of Agricultural Economics	1997	01	01	The contingent valuation method is often criticised for being grounded in a hypothetical market in which respondents are not actually required to make the contributions they claim to be willing to pay. This paper undertakes a non-experimental comparison of real and hypothetical donations towards the public good of environmental preservation, based on a carefully defined theoretical framework. Evidence is presented which suggests that the mean hypothetical payment obtained from an open-ended CV mail survey is likely to be at least four times as high as the real payments that would be collected from a comparable charitable appeal. In addition, it is found that in a hypothetical context people are less likely to opt out of making a donation - however, the donations which are made are on average no larger than those that could be expected in a real payment context. The implication is tentatively that the primary effect of the hypothetical context may be to reduce the extent of extreme free-riding, as opposed to creating incentives for strategic over-bidding. These results are subject to a number of significant empirical limitations.	Vivien Foster, Ian J. Bateman, David Harley

Bringing ecological economics out of the wilderness	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	This paper provides a brief look at the state of the art of use of economics in the designation and management of protected areas in Australia. To date, the formal use of economic analysis in making decisions concerning protected areas has been limited and ad hoc. This is illustrated for two of Australia's premier protected areas, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. It is argued that economic analysis can play a part in making policy on allocation of land to protected areas, and in the management of such areas. Based on experience to date, suggestions are offered for the future use of ecological economics in allocating and managing protected areas.	Sally M. Driml

Some issues in agrarian and ecological economics, in memory of Georgescu-Roegen	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Ecological critics of economics have argued for over one hundred years that economists should study the flow of energy and materials in the economy. The services nature offers to the human economy cannot be adequately valued in the accounting system of neoclassical environmental and resource economics. Today's ecological economics does not only critizice; it also tries to provide physical indicators in order to judge whether the economy is ecologically sustainable. Beyond its decisive role in strengthening such ecological economics, Georgescu-Roegen's work currently still holds sway in two additional fields: consumption theory (as analysed by Gowdy, 1993); and agrarian economics. Are there relations between such fields of study and ecological economics? In this article, I shall first focus on the agrarian question, and then on intra-and inter-generational ecological distribution.	J Martinez-Alier
Weak sustainability and viable technologies	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	The context of the concept of weak sustainability is examined using a three-tier hierarchy of value. We argue that weak sustainability is relevant only in the context of market exchange at a particular point in time. It offers an inadequate guide to the sustainability of social institutions and of the natural world. On the other hand, Georgescu-Roegen's concept of a viable technology recognizes that the integrity of the social and environmental systems surrounding market activity must be maintained if the human species is to persist through time. The concept of viability recognizes that market activity depends not only upon the sustaining functions of the environment but also upon the social sustaining functions of human institutions.

Willingness-to-pay for Borivli National Park: evidence from a Contingent Valuation	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	A study was conducted to survey the residents of Bombay and elicit their willingness to pay for the maintainance and preservation of Borivli National Park (BNP) using the Contingent Valuation (CV) method. The CV method has come under considerable criticism on account of biases that are either inherent to, or generated by the survey process. The present study acknowledges those, and adopts techniques to either circumvent or then minimise them. The authors pay special attention to hypothetical bias, starting point bias, embedding effects and part-whole biases. The authors argue that indeed it is possible to improve the quality of a CV by using special survey as well as statistical techniques so that CV results can be used for the purposes of realistic decision making. This validation of the CV becomes an important objective of the study. Despite India being a developing country with medium to low income levels, the evidence suggested that people are willing to pay for preserving environmental amenities. Having statistically adjusted for embedding and anchoring effects, households are willing to pay exclusively for BNP, on average, Rs 7.5, per month, for the next five years. Extrapolating to the city of Bombay, this amounts to a substantial Rs 20 million each month for the next five years, or a present discounted value of in excess of Rs 1 billion, suggesting a strong interest in environmental conservation.

Dynamic analysis of materials-product chains: An application to window frames	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Environmental pressure associated with a specific economic service can originate from several stages in the process of production, use and disposal of products rendering that particular service. When alternative products are available to fulfil such a service, an interesting evaluation problem results, because generally such alternatives will differ in terms of materials composition. This means that different or even unique materials flows and environmental stress categories will be associated with each of them. This type of evaluation problem is studied here using a materials-product chain framework, in which links between materials and product flows, and between decision, market and physical processes can be considered. The term 'chain' refers to a sequence of activities, possibly including extraction, production, consumption, materials recycling and re-use of products, and treatment, incineration and dumping of waste. Chain management can then be considered as an overall policy strategy that takes explicit account of the sequential economic and physical linkages between these various activities. A dynamic simulation model is developed for studying the materials-product chain associated with the use of window frames in houses. This provides an interesting example of a durable good, the use of which has important long-run consequences for material flows. A number of environmental and economic indicators are considered in the modelling exercise so that a comparison and evaluation of policies and scenarios from a broad, integrative perspective is possible. Among other things, this allows for a ranking of instruments.	Patricia P.A.A.H. Kandelaars, Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh
Ethics and Environmental Attitudes With Implications for Economic Valuation	Journal of Environmental Management	1997	01	01	This paper tests the hypothesis that different ethical belief systems are unrelated to the attitude an individual takes towards the environment. More specifically, the neoclassical economic approach is seen to require a belief in utilitarianism while many individuals may operate on the basis of a deontological or rights-based approach to decision-making. The concern with this relationship arises from the use of the cost-benefit analysis approach to environmental policy and the specific application of the contingent valuation method. Evidence is found to support the view that environmentalists choose to operate on a rights-based approach which rejects the relative welfare arguments of economics and positively attributes compensation to future generations for environmental damages. This implies that the contingent valuation of environmental attributes will lead to values which are biased towards technocentric optimists and against the environmental movement. In terms of policy, environmental management on the basis of totalling economic values is liable to be undemocratic because of the systematic exclusion of a section of the general public.	Clive L.

Spatial landscape indices in a hedonic framework: an ecological economics analysis using GIS	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	This paper develops a spatial hedonic model to explain residential values in a region within a 30-mile radius of Washington DC. Hedonic models of housing or land values are commonplace, but are rarely estimated for non-urban problems and never using the type of spatial data (geographical information system or GIS) available to us. Our approach offers the potential for a richer model, one that allows for spatial heterogeneity in estimation, and one that ties residential land values to features of the landscape. Beyond the traditional variables to explain residential values, such as man-made and ecological features of the parcel and distance to cities and natural amenities, we also hypothesize that the value of a parcel in residential land use is affected by the pattern of surrounding land uses, not just specific features of point locations. We have also created and added these variables to the hedonic model by choosing an appropriate area around an observation, and calculating measures of percent open space, diversity, and fragmentation of land uses, measured at different scales around that observation. These indices have, for the most part, been significant in the models. By including two of the landscape indices developed by landscape ecologists, we have developed a model that explains land and housing values more completely, by capturing how individuals value the diversity and fragmentation of land uses around their homes.

Toward a sustaining production theory	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Production is commonly described as the root of wealth creation, growth and progress. Mainline production theory ascribes this wealth generating ability to a limited number of inputs transformed into equally narrowly defined goods and services. Output which is not part of the official economy's market exchange, or inputs not employed in their production process remain external and unaccounted for. Many of these unaccounted for goods and inputs are provided in households, gardens, subsistence production, or ecological and biophysical systems through the 'free' services of women or nature. Thus an alternative view of production is suggested, one which views production itself as linked to the social and bio-physical contexts within which it takes place. This context first makes the generation of input streams, the receiving of output streams and the processing of inputs by means of fund factors (Georgescu-Roegen) possible. As production is contextualized it becomes evident that processes which sustain input generation, waste absorption and material transformation are critical to the production process. These are referred to as sustaining services. A sustaining production process is one which maintains sustaining services instead of destroying them. It is further argued that steps toward the implementation of a sustaining production concept require a move from abstraction to material concreteness. Three areas of concreteness are discussed as moving from solely monetary to physical valuation criteria, moving from methodological homogeneity to diversity, and moving from a mystified and distanced decision making process about quantity and quality of production to one of informed, participatory discourse.

A Bug Is a Bug Is a Bug: Symbolic Responses to Contingent Valuation Questions about Forest Pest control programs?	Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie	1997	01	01	Symbolic responses are one of many issues attending contingent valuation studies. The problem is that many objects that are the subject of contingent valuation surveys can act as symbols for larger issues. In this paper, we want to compare the attitudes of residents of five communities with two different forest pests, jack pine budworm and gypsy moth. Jack pine budworm affects commercially important forests in Canada, while gypsy moth generally affects recreational areas and has less commercial significance. All of the respondents were asked about both insects; however, not all of the communities had direct experience with both insects. The purpose is to examine whether respondents would differentiate their willingness to pay for control mechanisms between these different defoliators. The implication is that all bugs are alike and generally noxious, a notion that would not necessarily sit well with resource managers who have to deal with insect outbreaks. Respondents did not differentiate strongly between insect control programs that would impact their community and those that would not. While not conclusive, the results do suggest symbolic responses to this particular issue. This is further evidence that willingness-to-pay results from contingent valuation studies need to be cautiously interpreted as pseudo market values.	Heather MacDonald, Daniel W.

Fynbos (fine bush) vegetation and the supply of water: a comparison of multi-criteria decision analysis and cost-benefit analysis	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of a multi-criteria decision analysis approach to public sector decision making as opposed to cost-benefit analysis, particularly in the developing world where much of the population is outside of a market setting, where there is extreme inequality in the distribution of income, and the environment is a major factor of production. Multi-criteria decision analysis approaches are especially appropriate in participatory democracies where decision-making methods need to allow for direct input from those affected. The expansion of water provision to the Greater Metropolitan Cape Town area and the threats which it poses to the last relatively pristine fynbos mountain catchment areas in the Western Cape, is used as an illustrative example.

RESTORATION-BASED COMPENSATION MEASURES IN NATURAL RESOURCE LIABILITY STATUTES	Contemporary Economic Policy	1997	01	01	"In the past two decades, the U.S. Congress has passed several major environmental statutes that designate natural resource management agencies as trustees of the resources on behalf of the public and that allow the trustees to recover damages for injuries to public resources from releases of hazardous substances and discharges of oil. The standard measure of damages in the various statutes is the cost of restoring the resources to baseline conditions (""primary restoration"") plus the interim loss in alue from the time of the incident until full recovery from the injuries. However, trustees are allowed to spend their damage recoveries only on enhancing or creating (""restoring, rehabilitating, replacing or acquiring the equivalent of"") natural resources. The statutory restriction on the use of the recoveries has motivated the development of an alternative measure of damages for interim losses-the cost of ""compensatory restoration"" actions providing in-kind compensation-which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) incorporated in its 1996 regulations implementing the natural resource liability provisions of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA). This analysis first identifies the statutory measure of damages and the traditional framing of damages for interim losses (monetary compensation). It then defines an alternative utility-theoretic measure of resource compensation and identifies alter-native methods of implementation."	CAROL A. JONES, KATHERINE A. PEASE

Managing cattle grazing under degraded forests: An optimal control approach	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	In this paper aspects of knowledge generation and administration concerning management of a rural enterprise in the Argentine Chaco region are analyzed. The deterioration of natural resources and human living conditions show that forest-cattle interaction and the ecological economics of the system are poorly understood or not properly taken into account. A methodological solution to a typical decision-making problem is proposed here and illustrated by a worked example extracted from a real feasibility study. The introduction provides a summary of the natural history and of the human interventions in the region. Arguments on the roke of silvopastoral systems in reverting forest and soil degradation into sustainable productive undertakings are also exposed. The mathematical treatment of the problem follows a system theoretic approach. A basic nonlinear model for the dynamics is designed first. Its simplest version includes three state variables (livestock units, forest biomass and forage availability) and two manipulated variables (percentage of female calves sold each year and percentage of the cows that did not give birth during the past period and went for sale). States and controls are related by coupled differential-difference equations. Selected results from simulation are shown. Foundations are also laid for taking into account impulsional controls (selective and massive wood extractions, forage implantation, cattle additions and sales). The objective function reflects sustainable development principles. It evaluates the process in terms of usual economics and introduces ecological components of the management strategy. The total cost is expressed as the accumulation of net expenses made for a fixed number of years, minus the sale value of the firm at the end. Then a dynamic programming scheme is developed for finding optimal trajectories with respect to the basic setup. Shadow prices for the states are derived from the solution. Progress towards the building of a decision support system with the preceding elements is reported.	V. Costanza, C.E. Neuman
Explaining the environmental Kuznets curve: structural change and international agreements in reducing sulphur emissions	Environment and Development Economics	1997	01	01	Environmental Kuznets curves have been estimated using a simple reduced-form model that gives no information on the mechanisms underlying the estimated inverted U-shaped relationship between some pollutants and income. Various intuitive appealing explanations for the observed patterns have been offered, such as structural changes and environmental policy, but these have rarely been empirically investigated. Expanding the reduced-form model with explanatory variables may introduce serious multicollinearity problems, a reason why decomposition analysis is a preferable alternative for investigating the origins of change in emissions. Applying decomposition analysis fails to find evidence for structural changes as an important determinant of the impressive reductions in SO2 emissions of developed economies during the 1980s. Environmental policy, fostered by international agreements, gives a better explanation why pollution curbs downward at high income levels. Besides the level of income, the present state of the environment seems an important, but often neglected, variable that explains the ambition of environmental policy.	SANDER M. DE BRUYN

Recreational user management of parks: an ecological economic framework	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Recreational users are one of the major causes of ecosystem damage in publicly owned parks. To ensure the sustainability of these ecosystems, the damage impact of recreational users must be managed. A constrained park management goal is proposed that allows recreational users to pursue welfare derived from park experiences, subject to non-declining ecosystem health and equity of access. Four guiding principles (adaptable community control, quantity constraints, equity of access, and least cost policy mix) are used to provide a framework for recreational user management in three groups of park ecosystem. The funding of recreational user management is explored. Classifying park ecosystems into three groups, it was found that non-market mechanisms alone are suitable in Group 1 park ecosystems, with market mechanisms being of increasing importance in Group 2 and Group 3 park ecosystems.

Limits to economic growth as shown by a computable general equilibrium model	Ecological Economics	1997	01	01	Economic growth is distinguished from commercial growth and is defined in this article as the growth of the value a society puts in monetary terms on all commercial and non-commercial goods and values it possesses during a certain period. A computable general equilibrium model is used to show the impact of changes in the endowments, preferences and production possibilities on economic income, which in the model comprises all wealth. Besides land with its natural resources and labor, energy is the key endowment to drive an economy. The model leads in an intuitive way to the following conclusions: (1) Societies should start to use appropriate indicators for true economic growth, rather than just for commercial growth as measured by gross national product. (2) All types of economic growth are limited, no matter if based on endowment growth, production efficiency growth, or changes in preferences. (3) Economic growth should be oriented more towards increasing production efficiency and less towards using more natural resources. (4) Human population growth puts at risk the possibilities for average economic growth per person. (5) We should get better prepared to use solar energy in the future. (6) Besides economic growth, there exists pure utility growth, which is not measurable in monetary terms; it includes much of scientific progress in the long run and is of great importance even though it cannot be included in an indicator of economic growth.

Safe Minimum Standards: costs and opportunities	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	A 'Safe Minimum Standards' approach to environmental protection represents a supplement to cost-benefit analysis which places greater emphasis on the protection of the environment wherever thresholds of irreversible damage are threatened. It is based on the rationale of minimising maximum possible losses so long as the social costs of doing so are not 'unacceptable'. However, the concept of Safe Minimum Standards has been otherwise interpreted as justifying an abandonment of the need to quantify benefits deriving from preservation of the environment. It is frequently claimed that it is the opportunity costs of preservation,-i.e. the benefits of a proposed development-which represent the social costs of imposing a Safe Minimum Standards decision rule. Such a partial opportunity costs approach is not only contrary to the original concept, but may serve only to justify accepting the largest, and possibly most environmentally damaging, development projects. It is therefore also likely to produce recommendations that are contrary to what most proponents of the Safe Minimum Standards approach would endorse. Instead, it is proposed that SMS should be interpreted as favoring preservation in the face of irreversible environmental damage, unless the social costs of forgone development-defined as the benefits of development net of the expected benefits of environmental preservation that will be lost-are unacceptable. In this way, it can serve to moderate recommendations formulated according to underlying economic efficiency criteria, with respect to other, perhaps conflicting, social priorities.	Tom M. Crowards
Towards sustainable city policy: an economy-environment technology nexus	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Environmental problems have become a worldwide concern for economists, as is witnessed by the development of many theories and policies aimed at driving the economy towards a 'sustainable economy'. The problem becomes even greater if we discuss cities. As recognised in many studies, a high percentage of the world population lives in cities, where quality of life and environmental concerns undermine all advantages associated with agglomeration economies. The vast experience in terms of theoretical and empirical substance which has been built up around the theme of 'sustainable economy' has only partially helped to generate a framework for an 'urban sustainable development'. The city is in fact by definition an 'artifact environment', where well-established concepts of 'environmental economics' (such as natural capital stock, natural environment) can hardly be transferred and applied, in the way they are theoretically formulated. The first scope of the paper is to offer an analytical framework for 'urban sustainable development' to present the main economic concepts that are hidden under this label. In particular, different 'environments' co-exist in a city: the natural, the artifact and the social environment. Each of them generates positive and negative externalities for the city, since each of them represents 'use advantages' and 'use costs' for a city. If this is true, then it is a plausible assumption that the integration of these three 'environments' has to be supported with specific intervention policies. The main aim of this paper is to highlight the possible intervention policies which may be developed to achieve a balanced 'sustainable development' in terms of new policy principles that should govern the 'sustainable city'.

Searching for sustainability: The poverty of spontaneous order	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Traditional approaches to sustainability rely on models that depend upon judgments of welfare across future generations, 'right prices' and some sense as to what future persons will find giving of utility. These models both accept the spontaneous order of market processes and rely on that order to derive optimal consumption paths into the future. Sustainability is, however, not a problem of divining optimal paths predicated upon right prices. Rather, sustainability, to be operational, requires a prior constructed order predicated upon rights for future persons and duties for those now living who sit in a position as dictator over the settings and circumstances that will be passed on to future persons. Rights-based approaches to sustainability do not rely upon unknowable 'preferences' of future persons, but rather upon an 'environmental regency' in which those now living agree to preserve 'settings and circumstances' for the future. This reminds us that the issue of sustainability concerns not 'how much to preserve' but 'what to preserve.'	Daniel W Bromley
Land development and preservation over time and under uncertainty: a review and a research agenda	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	The combination of a rising interest in sustainable natural resource use and the increasingly fractious nature of the interactions between developers and preservationists has led to renewed interest in the question of appropriate natural resource management. In this paper I consider the question of land development and preservation over time and under uncertainty. I first review the extant literature and then I discuss its shortcomings. Next, I propose a research agenda which will enable us to shed light on some important management questions faced by land developers.	Amitrajeet A Batabyal

Contingent valuation and the activation of environmental norms	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	This paper uses contingent valuation (CVM) as the context in which to explore the implications of a model of altruistic norm-activation. A model is presented which provides a framework for thinking about the factors that individuals consider when formulating their responses to CVM questions, and the processes by which they bring such factors together. The activation of personal environmental norms, and hence positive willingness to pay, depends on four main categories of belief: awareness and acceptance of environmental need; consequences of personal action; responsibility for personal action; and acceptance of policy initiatives. The model is illustrated with a qualitative case study, and some of the implications for CVM are considered in light of these findings. It is argued that whilst notions of fairness may not present problems from a demand-prediction economic standpoint, such notions may be more problematic for the cost-benefit-analysis use of results.

Measuring the depreciation of Australia's non-renewable resources: a cautionary tale	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	The pursuit of sustainability is widely seen as requiring the calculation and publication of environmentally adjusted measures of national income, and/or of economic indicators intended to show whether or not economic behaviour is consistent with sustainability requirements. In either case a measure of natural resource depreciation is needed. The paper restricts its attention to non-renewable mineral resources, and measures their depreciation in Australia according to different methods proposed in the literature, using data published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The different methods are found to yield strikingly different results. The conclusion is that robust measurement of natural resource depreciation is unlikely, and that results appertaining to such should be treated sceptically.	Mick Common, Kali Sanyal
Valuation of tropical rainforests: philosophical and practical issues in the use of contingent valuation	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	This paper explores the possibility of using a large scale multi-country contingent valuation study for making decisions concerning global resources in the specific context of valuing a large set of tropical rainforests. Before considering the practical issues involved in implementing such a study, the paper addresses philosophical issues related to the use of contingent valuation including the role of passive use motives such as altruism and the role of information. The implications of empirically based criticisms which argue that contingent valuation results are unreliable are also considered. The main portion of the paper sketches the practical difficulties likely to be encountered in actually implementing a large contingent valuation study in multiple countries which seeks to value a common set of tropical rainforests. Some key study design choices are discussed.	Richard T Carson
Weak comparability of values as a foundation for ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	The main argument of this paper is that weak comparability of values should be seen as one characteristic feature of ecological economics. The formal properties of the concepts of strong comparability (implying strong or weak commensurability) and weak comparability (implying incommensurability) will be clarified. Multicriteria evaluation offers the methodological and mathematical tools to operationalize the concept of incommensurability at both macro and micro levels of analysis. The concept of incommensurability of values already has a long tradition in economics; moreover, we will show that analytic philosophy, theories of complexity, post-normal science and the recent theories of rationality lead with different trajectories to a non-algorithmic approach which, in our view, could be implemented by some forms of multicriteria evaluation.

Scope and limits of the market mechanism in environmental management	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	This paper tries to evaluate the role of the market mechanism in environmental management and warns against reductionist views on the causes and remedies of environmental damages. According to some of these views, proper pricing of the environment and extensive use of market mechanisms in environmental management would solve environmental problems. But various conditions tell against such simplifications, namely: the complex causality behind environmental damages; the complexity of the functions and values of nature; as well as limitations of the market mechanism in coping with the functions and services of nature. Several of those limitations-the difficulties of defining and enforcing property rights to nature's functions and services; the pervasiveness of externalities conditioned by the public goods characteristics of many environmental functions and values; the difficulties in enticing, processing and using information about environmental goods; and the high transaction costs caused by all these circumstances-often rule out contracts and trading of environmental services. It is less known that the basic cause of market existence and extension, namely specialization and division of labour, have negative environmental effects. With respect to environmental policy, conceptual problems are analyzed. While all kinds of environmental management mechanisms have a regulatory function, only quantity mechanisms, as a subset of incentive mechanisms, are market mechanisms. The choice of relevant environmental policy instrument is conditioned by many considerations. The issue of the superior efficiency properties of market mechanisms in environmental management is not yet settled satisfactorily; extensive empirical tests are still lacking.	Bo Gustafsson
Undesirable facilities and property values: a summary of empirical studies	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Undesirable land uses are expected to impose health or amenity risks on surrounding communities. These risks are expected to be translated economically into negative effects on adjacent property values. These negative effects may be present even when such uses possess offsetting advantages of proximity, such as employment opportunities. The purpose of this study is to summarize empirical studies completed to date that test whether undesirable land uses have observable negative effects on adjacent property values. This information may be useful in assessing minimum valuations of terminating undesirable land uses, such as clean-up of hazardous sites, or compensation necessary to ameliorate the economic impacts of new undesirable uses.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of woodland ecosystem restoration	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Ecosystem restoration has emerged as an important approach to safe-guarding biodiversity. In Scotland, the government is committed to restoring the natural woodland ecosystem of mountain areas and gives payments to landowners for establishing new woodlands. Although the aim of the policy is to restore a natural woodland ecosystem, the rate of payment available is correlated with the costs of establishment rather than the contribution new woodlands make to restoring the natural ecosystem. In this study, the cost-effectiveness of government expenditure is investigated by comparing the cost of grant aid with the ecosystem restoration potential of new woodlands. An expert-based system for scoring ecosystem restoration potential is described and applied to over 200 new woodlands in a Geographic Information System. New woodlands varied considerably with respect to both cost and ecosystem restoration score, with the most cost-effective woodlands established close to existing woodlands using natural colonisation techniques. Overall ecosystem score was negatively correlated with government expenditure. Alternative approaches to improving the cost-effectiveness of grant aid are discussed.	Douglas C.

Back to the future, back to basics: the social ecology of landscapes and the future of landscape planning	Landscape and Urban Planning	1998	01	01	This paper discusses what we believe are the key needs and assets of landscape planning at the close of the century. While landscape ecology and systems approaches have increased our understanding of ecological sustainability, this still fails to constitute a sufficient basis for prescribing overall regional sustainability. If we are to foster strategies that will effectively lead to sustainable regional development, we must, like our predecessors, investigate and advocate for a more critical social ecology of landscapes. While most of us venerate the works of Mumford, McHarg, and Olmstead, we generally forget two facts. First, their real value was in their ability to formulate and articulate socially and ecologically relevant arguments to the problems associated with an aberrant development paradigm. Second, they spoke not of strategy and technique, but of challenging and altering the dominant social theories and practices that have caused the degradation of our landscapes in the first place. Landscape planning is clearly ecologically relevant. Our challenge therefore lies in our social relevance. To become more socially relevant, landscape planners must become aware of, account for, incorporate, and challenge the problems and opportunities that cultural adoptability, economic viability, social equitability, and political relevancy have on the condition of our landscapes. For although natural processes largely determine the ecological condition of our landscapes, social processes will continue to determine the directionality these processes take. Since the fate of our landscapes lies in the hands of humankind, it is imperative that research move beyond traditional descriptions of space, academic divisions, and rational methods. We must also reassert vision, value, and ethic, account for the relationships among the physical, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of space, and finally, better incorporate the knowledges, perceptions, and practices that exist between the places we study and the peoples and communities who call them home.

Quasi-option value and climate policy choices	Energy Economics	1998	01	01	In the climate change issue, the environmental irreversibility (risk of an acceleration of mitigation policies if the worst happens) has to be balanced with the investment irreversibility (risk of over-cautious policies). To explore this balance, we define an option value for a precautionary climate policy. Using the simplest decision-making model, we expose how option value relates to the expected value of future information. Using quantitative data from an integrated assessment model, we find that most of the time the environmental irreversibility dominates the investment irreversibility. For all cases explored here, the order of magnitude of the option value was significant, about 50% of the opportunity cost.	Minh Ha-Duong
Contribution of Contingent Valuation and Other Stated Preference Methods to Evaluation of Environmental Policy	Australian Economic Papers	1998	01	01	Some form of stated preference method is essential for comprehensive evaluation of environmental policy options. The two most important stated preference methods are contingent valuation (CV) and choice modelling. I identify and discuss the major challenges facing CV and choice modelling researchers. Choice modelling applications to environmental valuation are comparatively recent, so the emphasis in this paper is on the more extensive body of CV research. The development of CV has been characterised by a (generally) constructive debate both within the economics profession, and between economists, philosophers, psychologists and other social scientists. As a result, much has been learnt about the nature of non-market economic values and how they might be measured. Important issues are the extent to which existing stated preference methods accurately represent individuals' values, and provide valid and reliable measures of changes in economic welfare. I review each of these issues in the light of recent theoretical and empirical work, identify the major outstanding problems, and indicate areas where progress is being made. I argue that the problems are solvable, and that eventually a theoretically sound and empirically effective method will be developed.	Michael Lockwood

Albedo and vegetation demand-side management options for warm climates	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	For electric utilities, demand-side management (DSM) can reduce electric load and shift load from peak to off-peak periods. In general, the investor in DSM collects the reward with lower electric bills, excepting a positive externality because of reduced tropospheric and stratospheric air pollution from fossil fuel power plants. In warm climates, DSM options include increasing albedo and vegetation, respectively, by painting surfaces white and planting trees; these DSM options are distinguished from all other DSM options because of ecosystem effects. Ambient temperature falls, mitigating the urban 'heat island', which reduces electric load and ozone formation. The investor in albedo and vegetation DSM options does not collect all of the reward from lower electric bills, since the lower ambient temperature provides savings to all customers who use electricity for air conditioning and refrigeration. Similar to other DSM options, air pollution is also reduced as a result of lower power plant emissions. Complex airshed models and electric utility system dispatch models are applied in this paper to account for some of these ecosystem effects. Unaccounted ecosystem effects remain, stymieing cost effectiveness analysis.	Darwin C Hall
Eco-thermodynamics: economics and the second law	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	The laws of physics, especially the first and second laws of thermodynamics, have significant implications for economic theory. The major implications of the First Law (conservation of mass/energy) are straightforward and have been discussed at length elsewhere. In brief, raw material inputs to economic processes are not 'consumed'. Having been extracted from the environment in the first place, they eventually return to the environment as wastes. The economic implications of the Second Law (entropy law) are far more subtle. There is considerable literature, initiated by the work of Georgescu-Roegen, on the supposed constraints on economic growth imposed by the fact that economic processes utilize 'low-entropy' raw materials (fossil fuels and high grade metal ores) and discard 'high entropy' wastes. However, as a practical matter the flux of available low-entropy energy (exergy) from the sun is extremely large and certainly adequate to sustain economic activity in the solar system indefinitely, even though fossil fuel and metal ore stocks may eventually be exhausted. It is argued in this paper that the real economic significance of the Second Law lies in the fact that exergy is: (i) not conserved; and (ii) is a useful common measure of resource quality, as well as quantity, applicable to both materials and energy. Thus, exergy can be used to measure and compare resource inputs and outputs, including wastes and losses. This is potentially important in itself. Moreover, since exergy is not conserved it is truly consumed (i.e. used up) in economic processes. Hence, exergy is no less a 'factor of production' than labor or capital. This fact has strong implications for economic growth theory, especially with regard to assessing the role of technical progress.	Robert U Ayres
Beyond the economics of more: the place of consumption in ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	The relation between consumption and welfare, generally assumed by orthodox economists, must be re-examined by ecological economists. Present attitudes towards consumption among the latter are often ambiguous, resulting in a modified form of consumerism. Yet questioning the often dubious benefits of consumption is as important for the environmental debate as emphasising its neglected costs. Beyond basic needs satisfaction, it is at most one's consumption level relative to others which counts for welfare, so that benefits from consumption cannot be increased in the aggregate. Thus there is much scope for reducing consumption (and thus, environmental costs) while increasing or maintaining welfare. Identifying those goods the consumption of which adds little or nothing to welfare, and assessing the effect of reducing their consumption on resource use, natural and human, should be a major concern of an ecological economics aimed at promoting sustainable welfare.	John Lintott
Scientific methodology for ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Positivist philosophy has dominated scientific research throughout most of the twentieth century. Positivism has been discredited within the philosophy of science but this has only had limited impact on research practices in the social and natural sciences. Economists have called for the adoption of positivism in economics, however, economic methodologists have noted that this application has not taken place and, because of the limitations of positivism, it is unlikely that it will take place. Ecological economists should learn from the methodological failures of economics and look for alternatives. Since the 1970s, several alternative paradigms to positivism have emerged. Post-normal science and constructivism are critically considered and their significance for the discipline of ecological economics is addressed in this paper. I propose a modification of the paradigmatic basis of constructivism and suggest that the revised constructivist paradigm should be seriously considered for adoption by ecological economists. I also point out that there are complementarities between post-normal and constructivist methodologies that deserve further exploration. This could enrich the methodological base of ecological economics.	Luca Tacconi
Traditional production, communal land tenure, and policies for environmental preservation in the South Pacific	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Instead of maximizing the expected monetary return of land usage, Pacific islanders manage land so that it renders an optimal mix of cash income and non-monetary cultural goods. Evidence from cropping patterns in Fiji suggests that the production of these cultural goods is linked to traditional agriculture which produces less ecological deterioration than its commercial counterpart. The capacity for village land to support traditional activities is highest under a regime of communal land tenure where decision making is centralized. A regime of private land tenure lowers this capacity because decentralized decision making raises the coordination costs of preserving special areas of land for traditional purposes. This means that if development planners rush to replace traditional regimes of communal land tenure with 'modern' systems of private land ownership, they might also observe a correlated increase in land degradation, even if new codes of private property are perfectly enforceable. A two-sector growth model can be used to show that the welfare-neutral 'bribe' required from the government to increase the amount of village land preserved in the steady state is lower under a regime of communal land tenure. One counterintuitive result is that a high subjective discount rate does not always imply a high level of environmental degradation. Observations from the South Pacific have application for environmental policy in other developing countries.	Philip T Powell
Aggregation and deliberation in valuing environmental public goods:	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Starting from a distinction between Kantian (principle-based) and utilitarian (preference-based) approaches in political theory, this essay argues that we may understand normative judgments individuals make about policy to express principled views of the public interest or purpose not private preferences about their own consumption opportunities. These judgments, in other words, state opinions about what we ought to do as a society rather than report preferences about what I want as a utility-maximizer. This essay then argues that contingent valuation can take into account these kinds of judgments-which dominate public discourse about the environment-only if it moves toward a deliberative, discursive, jury-like research method emphasizing informed discussion leading toward a consensus based on an argument about the public interest.

Commensuration and theories of value in ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Without a theory of value (price) in ecological economics, the valuation of ecosystem and economic resources cannot be rigorously defended. At the crux of the matter is the 'valuation' or 'mixed units' problem of commensurating biophysical inputs/outputs which are different. This paper critically reviews candidate theories of value which have emerged in the ecological economics literature for dealing with this problem. First of all, the Neo-Ricardian approach, using Sraffa-type systems is discussed. In particular, Judson's assertion that the Sraffa system is suitable for ecological economics is questioned, as it is based on 'circular flow', generation of a 'surplus' and 'exchange values'. None of these ideas are consistent with a biophysical characterisation of an economic system, which is paramount in ecological economics. A more fruitful avenue for establishing a biophysical theory of value based on ecological and thermodynamic principles, is to extend Patterson's quality equivalent methodology (QEM) to explicitly include mass flows in addition to energy. At this point a model close to Costanza and Hannon's biosphere model of price determination emerges. The extended QEM model however, has a number of important advantages over the Costanza-Hannon model because it has a more generalised formulation and is not reliant on necessarily using solar energy as the numeraire. The paper concludes with a discussion of some outstanding issues that need to be resolved before a biophysical theory of value can be properly established in ecological economics.	Murray Patterson
Respondents' evaluations of a CV survey: a case study based on an economic valuation of the Wildlife Enhancement Scheme, Pevensey Levels in East Sussex	Area	1998	01	01	Summary Environmental economists have developed a methodology for eliciting individual preferences by asking respondents to a contingent valuation survey how much they would be willing to pay for specified environmental 'goods'. Contingent valuation generates considerable debate, not least because it is unclear how people arrive at a monetary value or whether the elicited monetary value bears any relation to how individuals actually value the environmental 'good'. In this paper, we present preliminary results from a qualitative study of how respondents construct their responses to a CV survey, to suggest that the methodology does not measure what it purports to measure.

Multiattribute elicitation of wilderness preservation benefits: a constructive approach	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	This paper contributes to the development of a constructive approach to evaluating environmental resources, using a version of multiattribute value elicitation in a group setting. Section 1discusses the assumptions and practices of group multiattribute elicitation for public policy decisions. The good of interest is a potential doubling of designated wilderness areas in British Columbia. Two groups, totalling 28 subjects, participated in intensive half-day workshops in which they provided judgments regarding the amounts of tax revenues from forest industry activities each thought provincial residents should forego to achieve specified increases in wilderness preservation. Subjects were asked to consider direct and passive use values, spiritual values, and ecological service values. Subjects were also asked to consider separately the interests of the current generation and future generations of residents and to provide judgments regarding the marginal benefits of increasing preservation. An initial aggregated valuation question was followed by five more disaggregated questions. Subjects then compared and reconciled their value judgments for the aggregated and disaggregated questions. The results are generally comparable to those of a contingent valuation referendum-based survey for the same valuation issues.	Timothy L. McDaniels, Craig Roessler
Merging economic sense and ecological sensibility: environment-driven response to corporate change	Strategic Change	1998	01	01	Global industrial structures and the market mechanism, vested economic interests and contemporary environment taxation do not favour sustainable business practices and/or clean technologies. It is argued that mainstream economics and management theories cannot adequately handle the internalization of environmental dimensions. The first conclusion is therefore that industry-except for a few pioneers-is still far from having translated all the fine words into practical deeds. While the principle of sustainable development challenges some of the assumptions of economic theory, the field of corporate environmental and resource management is still too young to offer a fully tried and tested alternative of its own.

The value of biodiversity: Where ecology and economy blend	Biological Conservation	1998	01	01	As problems of environmental change become more evident, we increasingly realize how much we depend upon wildlife for a wide range of so-called ecosystem services. These services, which include soil protection, pest control and the supply of clean water, are to a significant extent provided by natural and semi-natural ecosystems which in the past were thought to have little or no economic significance. This recognition has important implications for conservation. The emerging discipline of ecological economics provides methods for assessing the economic value of wildlife. While it is idle to pretend that the application of such methods will solve the biodiversity crisis, economic analysis can be useful in strengthening the case for conservation. Such analysis can demonstrate the potentially high economic value of wildlife, and reveal more clearly the economic and social pressures which threaten it. It is argued that while nature reserves and other protected areas will always be important, we must shift our attention increasingly to the preservation of biological diversity within the major forms of land-use. High priority must be given to finding ways of restoring biological diversity and enhancing ecosystem function in those areas which have already been seriously damaged. In these tasks ecological economics has an important role to play.	Peter J. Edwards, Cyrus Abivardi
Reducing degradation of forests in poor countries when permanent solutions elude us: what instruments do we really have?	Environment and Development Economics	1998	01	01	This paper evaluates policies for addressing forest degradation in developing country hill areas, where agriculture is the major activity and villagers depend on forests for important economic inputs. Population growth, poverty, and open access probably explain most 'overuse' in such areas, but these are very difficult, long-term problems. The paper argues that under such conditions interim demand-side policies should be seriously considered, but the case is also made that the set of feasible instruments is quite small. Focusing on the case of Nepal, two instruments for reducing fuelwood demand - promotion of more efficient, wood-burning cookstoves and policies that reduce the prices of alternative fuels (e.g., through subsidies) - are evaluated. Using a simple analytical model and results from two household surveys conducted in Nepal, it is concluded that promoting improved stoves is a much more efficient and equitable instrument than, for example, subsidizing the major alternative fuel, which is kerosene. The cost of fuelwood saved using improved stoves is predicted to be a very low $2.77 per metric ton.	RANDALL A. BLUFFSTONE
Environmental Kuznets curves-real progress or passing the buck?	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Recent research has examined the hypothesis of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC)-the notion that environmental impact increases in the early stages of development followed by declines in the later stages. These studies have focused on the relationship between per capita income and a variety of environmental indicators. Results imply that EKCs may exist for a number of cases. However, the measures of environmental impact used generally focus on production processes and reflect environmental impacts that are local in nature and for which abatement is relatively inexpensive in terms of monetary costs and/or lifestyle changes. Significantly, more consumption-based measures, such CO2 emissions and municipal waste, for which impacts are relatively easy to externalize or costly to control, show no tendency to decline with increasing per capita income. By considering consumption and trade patterns, the author re-examines the concept of the EKC and proposes the use of alternative, consumption-based measures of environmental impact. The author speculates that what appear to be improvements in environmental quality may in reality be indicators of increased ability of consumers in wealthy nations to distance themselves from the environmental degradation associated with their consumption.

Sustainability and beyond	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	In this paper I discuss both the limitations and possible uses of the sustainability discourse. I begin by convassing various conceptions of sustainability and sketching some difficulties with the notions that have been introduced. Next some possible uses of the idea of sustainability are identified. I go on to discuss these in the context of disputes over public lands in the United States. Finally I say why we must go beyond sustainability if we are successfully to address the present disorder regarding the human relationship to nature.	Dale Jamieson
Administering contingent valuation surveys in developing countries	World Development	1998	01	01	Ten years ago only a handful of very rudimentary contingent valuation (CV) studies had been conducted in developing countries; at that time the problems associated with posing hypothetical questions to low-income, perhaps illiterate respondents were assumed to be so overwhelming that one should not even try. Today it is now assumed by many environmental and resource economists and policy analysts working in developing countries that contingent valuation surveys are straightforward and easy to do. This paper examines some of the issues that have arisen and some of the lessons learned over the last 10 years about administering contingent valuation surveys in developing countries. The paper focuses on five issues in particular. 1. (a) explaining to enumerators what a contingent valuation study is all about; 2. (b) interpreting responses to contingent valuation questions; 3. (c) setting referendum prices; 4. (d) constructing joint public-private CV scenarios; 5. (e) ethical problems in conducting such surveys. It is argued that there are numerous issues that arise in contingent valuation work in developing countries that demand careful attention, but that in many respects it is easier to do high-quality contingent valuation surveys in developing countries than in industrialized countries.

Progress on the environmental Kuznets curve?	Environment and Development Economics	1998	01	01	The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis proposes that there is an inverted U-shape relation between environmental degradation and income per capita. This has been taken to imply that economic growth will eventually redress the environmental impacts of the early stages of economic development. The literature on this issue has developed rapidly over the last few years. This paper examines whether progress has been made on both understanding the EKC phenomenon and on addressing the various criticisms raised against some of the empirical studies and their interpretation in the policy literature. Though basic EKC studies continue to be carried out, recent work has focused on the effect of a variety of conditioning variables on the environmental impact-GDP relationship. Some attempts have also been made to examine the history of the relationship in individual countries. The econometric techniques used have improved. However, empirical decompositions of the EKC into proximate or underlying causes are either limited in scope or non-systematic, and explicit testing of the various theoretical models has not yet been attempted.

Research needs and methods for decentralised economic planning	Agricultural Systems	1998	01	01	International debates on food and agricultural policy increasingly endorse the principles of the free market and stress the responsibilities of national governments for active policies to manage development, to achieve food security and to safeguard the environment. This paper argues that consequently policy-oriented research needs to establish databases and develop models, in which both rural and urban households figure prominently and in a properly geo-referenced manner. This will enable the policy analyst to design policies and to monitor their effect on a regional basis. The paper emphasises that policy-oriented research should provide a nationwide perspective, because in relation to sustainability, as far as environmental economics is concerned, virtually all theory and theory-based policy guidelines have been formulated for national economies in their totality. With respect to the representation of agricultural production itself, we discuss a class of spatial estimation techniques that can deal with missing data and account for qualitative observations, and that can make full use of spatially explicit information on crop yield potentials as generated by agro-ecological models.

Using a geographic information system for applied policy analysis: the case of logging in the Eastern Amazon	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Using a geographic information system (GIS), a spatial and dynamic model of timber extraction was constructed and used to forecast industry growth in the Eastern Amazon over the next 10 years. Once calibrated, the model was used to project future harvests and the stock of forest resources over time under different price increase and policy scenarios. The results suggest a limited role for the state in influencing the pace of industrial growth, but a larger role in determining where extraction might occur. In particular, the state can exercise substantial influence over the spread of logging through the designation of indigenous, military and nature reserves as protected areas and through the decision of where to build and pave roads. Imposing new regulations, by contrast, may have unintended consequences such as constraining intensive extraction while promoting selective extraction in areas more difficult to enforce.	Steven W.

Towards an ecological theory of unequal exchange: articulating world system theory and ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	The focus of this paper is on how an ecological perspective might provide us with an analytically more precise way of defining 'unequal exchange.' It is only by looking at the ecological conditions of human economies that we can adequately conceptualize the mechanisms which generate inequalities in distribution. Considerations of market power aside, neoclassical economic ideology has dispelled all possible criteria for assessing a market transaction as unequal or unfair. One way to assess the occurrence of unequal exchange may be to look at the direction of net flows of energy and materials (concrete, productive potential), but without falling into the trap of equating productive potential with economic value. On the contrary, it can be analytically demonstrated that unequal exchange emerges from a kind of inverse relationship between productive potential and economic value. The notion of a reasonable market price conceals the fact that what is being exchanged are intact resources for products representing resources already spent. If we consider, longitudinally along the production process, any given set of fuels and raw materials destined to be transformed into a given product plus waste, its content of available energy will be inversely related to its utility or price. In other words, the more of its original energy that has been dissipated, the higher its price. This means that 'production' (i.e. the dissipation of resources) will continuously be rewarded with ever more resources to dissipate, generating ecological destruction and global, core/periphery inequalities as two sides of the same coin.

Modelling sustainable development as a problem in earth science	Mathematical and Computer Modelling	1998	01	01	"Sustainable development requires the construction of interdisciplinary models for evaluating and quantifying the effects of ongoing economic policies on the delicate interplay between living populations (notably human), natural resources, environment, and economic development. This paper examines how, conceivably, one could try to expand geophysical and biogeochemical models, now being actively developed, to include, in a ""common"" language, enough of the cogent indicators of long-term economic policies to generate such models."

Indicators of Dematerialization and the Materials Intensity of Use	Journal of Industrial Ecology	1998	01	01	"We review the major empirical analyses of the related concepts of dematerialization and intensity of use. Dematerialization refen to the absolute or relative reduction in the quantity of materials used and/or the quantity of waste generated in the production of a unit of economic output A common indicator is the intensity of material use, which is the quantity of material used per unit of economic output. Our discussion focuses on seven topics: the environmental Kuznets curve for materials, material use and long wave theory material decomposition analysis, statistical, inpuboutput and dynamic models of material use, and analyses of national material use. We examine the measurement of aggregate material use and waste emissions, hypothesis testing, the importance of imports, and forces that countervail dematerialization such as rising affluence and the ""rebound effect."" We conclude that: our knowledge of the extent of and mechanisms behind the patterns of material use are limited largely to individual materials or very specific industries, and most of those examples are metals; the economy is getting ""lighter"" but the aggregate economic significance of that trend, if any, is unknown; there is no compelling macroeconomic evidence that the US. economy is ""decoupled"" from material inputs; and we know even less about the net environmental effects of many changes in materials use. We caution against gross generalizations about material use, particularly the ""gut"" feeling that technical change, substitution, and a shift t o the ""information age"" inexorably lead to decreased materials intensity and reduced environmental impact. We end with some suggestions for research that may help answer these important questions."	Cutler J. Cleveland, Matthias Ruth

Economic growth, trade and energy: implications for the environmental Kuznets curve	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis asserts that pollution follows an inverted-U path with respect to economic growth. The EKC has been explained in terms of structural changes in the composition of economic output and increased environmental regulation at higher income levels. While some authors have incorporated the impact of trade policy orientation on the EKC, the impact of the actual movement between countries of goods that embody pollution has not been considered. This paper attempts to econometrically quantify the effect using pooled cross-country and time-series data. The EKC hypothesis is examined with respect to commercial energy consumption, the source of many serious environmental problems. It was found that while both industrializing and industrialized countries have added to their energy requirements by exporting manufactured goods, the growth has been substantially higher in the former. At the same time, industrialized countries have been able to reduce their energy requirements by importing manufactured goods. Exports of manufactured goods by industrialized countries has thus been an important factor in generating the upward sloping portion of the EKC and imports by industrialized countries have contributed to the downward slope.

Ethical influences on the evolution of the US tradable permit approach to air pollution control	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	In 1975 a novel approach to air pollution control was implemented in the USA. From this rather humble beginning this approach has now been expanded rather dramatically in several different directions. This paper describes this evolution, shows how the design of the system has been adapted to accommodate ethical concerns, and describes how the latest versions of this approach have transformed the regulatory process which spawned the approach in the first place.

Economic and environmental modelling for pollution control in an estuary	Journal of Environmental Management	1998	01	01	This paper reports on results from an environmental-economic modelling exercise aimed at quantifying the potential cost savings from a Tradable Pollution Permits (TPPs) scheme in the Forth Estuary, Scotland. Such a scheme might be introduced to control inputs of biological oxygen demand more cheaply than the current regulatory system. A 'MIKE 11' water-quality model is combined with step-wise integer and linear programming models representing firms' abatement costs. Cost savings under a deterministic scenario are compared with savings under a stochastic scenario, where transfer coefficients, relating discharges to ambient water quality, are allowed to vary. Potential cost savings appear to exist in both cases, although these cost savings are less in the stochastic case. The paper concludes by considering potential barriers to any real-life TPP market actually achieving these potential cost savings.	Nick Hanley, Robin Faichney, Alastair Munro, James S. Shortle
Evaluating the environmentally sensitive areas: the value of rural environments and policy relevance	Journal of Rural Studies	1998	01	01	Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) have come to take a central place in agri-environmental policy. An important evaluation of the scheme has sought to estimate the value of two ESAs using the contingent valuation method. This paper assesses this evaluation and argues that in practice the method failed to establish a clear and realistic description of the likely outcome of the policy. In a number of respects, the evaluation assumes that the policy will be successful prior to the analysis. These concerns are supported by the evidence available from monitoring studies. In consequence the evaluation is of limited use for the purposes of policy decision-making. There is a need to define the likely outcomes of policy more realistically, recognising the inevitable uncertainty, and to investigate the values of conservation at the margin in order to make such evaluations more relevant to policy development.

How might nature value man?	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	While much time and effort is spent attempting to quantify environmental services for inclusion in the economic system, no one seems to ask how nature might value us. An ecological accounting process is devised to accommodate ecosystem flows, allowing for the computation of ecological prices, and leading to the calculation of net ecosystem output and the efficiency of its production. The process is somewhat similar to economic accounting, but allows us to consider the ecosystem as open, conforming to thermodynamic laws. Examples, such as intervention to reduce soil erosion, illustrate how humans might be appreciated by the ecosystem. In some instances, the net output might be higher with some human presence than with no human presence.	Bruce Hannon
The rhetorics of ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1998	01	01	Since the early 1980s, there has been a lively discussion about the rhetoric of economics. Ecological economists, however, so far have not tried to incorporate this discussion into their work. This paper is a first step towards including the discourse on rhetoric into the self-awareness of ecological economics. After a brief outline of what this discourse is about, the importance of metaphors as one aspect of rhetoric is examined. Connections of the rhetorical discourse to ecological economics as a post-normal science are shown. It is argued that two rhetorics of ecological economics can be distinguished: internal and external rhetoric. While the former refers mostly to methodological issues, the latter is of particular importance for the political impact that ecological economics can have. Finally, some suggestions for research are made.	Fred Luks

A dynamic model of biodiversity preservation	Environment and Development Economics	1998	01	01	This paper attempts to develop a dynamic model of optimal biodiversity preservation in a stylized ecosystem. Species richness (number of species) is used as a measure of diversity and its interactions with the resource stock, consumptive extraction and preservation efforts are explored using a two-state variable optimal control model. The analysis extends to the implications of a random threshold in species richness and the relationship between ecological and economic stability conditions. Dynamic paths and equilibrium characteristics are illustrated using numerical techniques.	CHUAN-ZHONG LI, KARL-GUSTAF L√ñFGREN
A review of cost-benefit analysis as applied to the evaluation of new road proposals in the U.K.	Transportation Research Part D	1998	01	01	The U.K. Department of Transport's COBA program is used to evaluate proposed highway schemes. COBA compares construction and maintenance costs against the benefits (time savings plus fuel and non-fuel vehicle operating costs plus accident savings) of a highway proposal. COBA does not value environmental externalities of highways developments in monetary terms: externalities such as noise, visual intrusion, recreation loss, air pollution, wildlife, etc., are merely documented in terms if their physical impacts, leaving decision-makers to judge the overall merit of the highway scheme. The paper documents the extent to which various amenity values are incorporated or excluded under current procedures, and the need to incorporate consumer surplus values. The paper also illustrates how the market price of land can be adjusted to reflect its social opportunity cost. Amenity benefits lost as a consequence of new road schemes are seen to mainly comprise loss of amenity value to the general public rather than to the owners of land. The paper argues that these amenity values of lost access; wildlife; and landscape preservation, etc., can be successfully valued through stated preference (SP) and contingent ranking (CR) methods; and that they should be incorporated into a full cost-benefit analysis of alternative route proposals.

Dynamics of soil acidification: an economic analysis	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper studies the dynamic aspects related to the problem of acidification. It shows how accumulation of acidification in ecosystems can be studied in economic modelling by incorporating dynamic aspects of soil acidification. In contrast to the often applied critical loads approach which only focuses on the final state of a soil, the dynamic approach applied in this study gives information about the temporal development of the quality of a soil. Using an economic optimal control model containing these dynamic aspects the paper compares abatement policies based on static critical loads to abatement policies based on a dynamic analysis. It shows that soil dynamics play an essential role in identifying optimal policies. Based on numerical simulations cost-effective abatement strategies for combined reduction of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are determined. It is also shown that abatement cost savings may be realised when intertemporal cost efficiency is taken into account. The results indicate that current European policies which are based on a critical loads approach instead of dynamic analysis of soil quality, are non-optimal from both an ecological and an economic point of view.

Should the rules of allocating emissions permits be harmonised?	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The Kyoto Protocol is the first international environmental agreement that sets legally binding greenhouse gas emissions targets and timetables for Annex I countries. Its Article 17 authorizes emissions trading among Annex B countries. If properly designed, emissions trading can effectively reduce their abatement costs, while assisting Annex I countries in achieving their Kyoto obligations. If Annex B governments elect to allocate the assigned amounts to their individual sub-national legal entities and authorize them to trade on the international emissions permits market, I argue that individual governments should be left free to devise their own ways of allocating emissions permits.

Toward consilience between biology and economics: the contribution of Ecological Economics	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	During its ten year history Ecological Economics has made a real difference in the way economists look at the natural world and in the way biologists look at the economy. In this survey article we examine the contributions to the Journal in terms of E.O. Wilson's concept of 'consilience', that is, his argument that the methods and assumptions of any field of study should be consistent with the known and accepted facts in other disciplines. In particular, we examine the contributions of ecological economics to reconciling the economic theory of the consumer and producer with biophysical reality.	John M. Gowdy, Ada Ferreri Carbonell

Economics of a Baltic Sea sustainability approach	Limnologica	1999	01	01	Abstract: Politics, economics and science interpret the concept of sustainability differently. The discussion distinguishes between economic, environmental and social sustainability. While advocates of economic sustainability assume that natural capital is substitutable by humanmade capital, policies for a sustainable development are questionable. The paper therefore highlights a regional case to show that sustainability is indivisible. Moreover, economics and policies serving Baltic sustainability need a new institutional network to manage the multispecies resource with participation of the social players and by addressing targets step by step. The findings are based on a simple ecological-economic model providing insights for the negotiation game for all players. In addition, multispecies resource management shows a strong hierarchy in both social actions and targets. Since sustainable development is an on-going, dynamic process, policy implementation and funding must also be continuous. Sustainable development therefore challenges the institutional sets for the process and its relations to local, regional and national policies.	J√∂rg K√∂hn
Bargaining to preserve a unique ecosystem: the role of anticipatory investments to establish stronger bargaining positions	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	A forester and a conservation organization bargain over the commercial exploitation or preservation of a forested tract of land with unique ecological characteristics. The forester can improve its bargaining position by preparing a portion of the land for future timber production prior to negotiations between the two. However, doing so decreases the preservation value of the forest, as well as the compensation the conservation group is willing to pay to preserve the forest. The analysis suggests that the forester will begin preparing the land for timber production prior to negotiations only when the value of the land in timber production is significantly lower than the preservation values of the conservation group.

Use value, exchange value, and resource scarcity	Energy Policy	1999	01	01	"I review the literature on natural resource scarcity indicators. Scarcity indicators can be classified by what is being measured: value of the resource stock or value of extracted resource commodities; who's value is considered: social vs. private scarcity; and by the mode of valuation considered: exchange value and use value. Prices and rents are common measures of exchange value or indicators of ""exchange scarcity"" and unit costs can be seen as use value indicators or indicators of ""use scarcity"". The major aim of this paper is to demonstrate the links between productivity indicators such as unit costs and the classical concept of use value. The two classes of indicator relate to John Commons' discussions of scarcity and efficiency, and a marginal vs. a non-marginal approach to value and scarcity. The classical use value concept also has wider relevance for issues of valuation in energy, resource, and environmental policy."	David I Stern
Natural capital and quality of life: a model for evaluating the sustainability of alternative regional development paths	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Natural capital contributes to the quality of life of a region in two complementary ways: first, by directly providing environmental services that cannot be imported, and second, by supplying the natural resources that, through a human controlled production process, become valuable to humans. The evolution of the combination of these two components of the quality of life determines the path of development a region takes. Environmental services also determine the ability of natural capital to regenerate itself. Ecosystems and other components of the regional natural capital produce environmental services that provide life-support functions necessary for natural capital reproduction. The destruction of this critical natural capital impairs the internal sources of improvement of the quality of life of a region, leading to a non-sustainable path of development. This article describes a model of the relationship between natural capital and quality of life that provides a stricter definition of sustainable development through explicit characterization and classification of natural capital according to its ability to produce life-supporting environmental services, by its substitutability, and by its possible reconstruction. Application of this model then shows that there are 51 possible regional development paths, only 32 of which are sustainable and only 14 of which are sustainable while also providing improvements in quality of life. Only six of these 14 sustainable development paths are attained with economic growth, however, while the other eight paths increase quality of life by increasing the production of environmental services. The model could help in the development of institutional interventions that would promote regional development paths that are sustainable.	Cecilia Collados, Timothy P Duane
Thresholds and complementarities in an economic model of preserving and conserving biodiversity	Socio-Economic Planning Sciences	1999	01	01	When production destroys habitat, the number of species diminishes. Endangered species can be rescued by conservation biology and restoration ecology, which are represented in this paper by a production function for biological diversity. Until the number of species satisfies the classical species-area relationship for the total land area of the ecological economy, it is assumed that there are increasing returns to scale in rescuing species. It follows mathematically that there is a threshold level of biodiversity, which has implications comparable to ecological thresholds. There are also complementarities, because increases in the target number of species increase the optimal human population and the optimal level of total production. A numerical example is presented that yields results descriptive of the ecological economy of Costa Rica.	Robert E. Kohn
Applying the concept of natural capital criticality to regional resource management	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper applies the concept of natural capital stock, and identifies its critical elements, in a regional sustainable development context in order to assess its conceptual and practical relevance. Assessment of the physical stock of natural capital was undertaken for Central Region in Scotland. It was found that the concept can be a useful way of assessing, and giving greater recognition to natural resources at a regional or local level. However, identification of critical levels of resources was less straightforward. The lack of clear guidelines relating to criteria of criticality, natural capital category aggregation issues, and conflicts between types of critical natural capital were encountered as major issues. The application of an absolute preservation rule was found to suffer from the same general disadvantages as any absolute rule. Nevertheless, the assessment of natural capital and identification, where possible, of critical elements were thought to be a useful adjunct to sustainable development work.

Incorporating distributional considerations in the safe minimum standard approach: endangered species and local impacts	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Explicitly incorporating current distributional concerns into the safe minimum standard (SMS) approach is the objective of this study. The SMS approach is a collective choice process that prescribes protecting a minimum level of a renewable natural resource unless the social costs of doing so are somehow excessive or intolerably high. More complete implementation of an SMS approach, if it is to be a pragmatic policy tool, requires that distributional considerations be included in determining whether the economic consequences of preservation actions are intolerable. Two case studies involving the US Endangered Species Act are used to illustrate how distributional concerns might be incorporated into the SMS approach.	Robert P. Berrens, Michael McKee, Michael C.

Economic efficiency, resource conservation and the ivory trade ban	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) trade ban on ivory remains controversial despite a recent decision to permit some exports by three African countries. In this paper, we examine arguments opposing and supporting the trade ban, concluding that the case for maintaining the ban is strong. We demonstrate that permitting some trade is not a panacea because of potential strategic behavior, and that resuming restricted trade gives an impetus to illegal poaching by enhancing the possibility to launder illegal ivory. Analysis of the pre-ban data, and using the approach dynamics for a steady state, indicates that, when trade in ivory is allowed, poaching could drive the African elephant to extinction. The trade ban arrests this path of decline. Thus, care should be taken before lifting the trade ban.	Erwin H. Bulte, G.Cornelis van Kooten
Ecotourism: a means to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem functions?	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper argues that, at present, ecotourism can contribute to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem functions in developing countries, even though meeting the requirements for ecotourism is extremely difficult. A cost-benefit analysis of those ecosystems richest in species diversity, i.e. tropical rainforests, leads to the conclusion that non-use values often outweigh the values of conventional uses (clear-cutting, pasture, etc.), but are hardly considered in development decisions. Therefore, tourism and its high direct use value can play an important role as an incentive for protection. As tourism causes significant emissions, e.g. by flying, the concept of Environmental Damage Costs is introduced and integrated into the calculations. Further, international tourism development is analyzed and related to protection goals. Visitation rates of sensitive areas need to be limited; education, management, and control measures have to be integrated; and the proportion of money captured from tourists has to be increased. In the long run, tourism needs to undergo substantial changes.	Stefan G√∂ssling
The double dividend, second-best worlds, and real-world environmental policy	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The recent series of papers by Bovemberg, Goulder, Parry and others argue that the double dividend is unlikely to exist because of second-best problems. They argue that the imposition of environmental tax in an economy already distorted by income taxes will further distort the economy by reducing incentives to supply labor. Our paper argues that this is not likely to be the case because of the restrictive assumptions made by these models, and because of the role of the environment as a factor of production.

A regulatory framework for a policy of sustainability: lessons from the neo-liberal school	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	In this paper, targets, institutions and policy measures for describing and implementing sustainable development are evaluated in terms of their conformity with the economic framework of a market system. From the viewpoint of neo-liberal economic thinking as conceived by the German Freiburg school of economists, a general set of criteria is developed. It includes issues of operationalization and legitimation of goals as well as institutional and instrumental issues. On this basis, general rules for designing an ecological framework guaranteeing the greatest possible degree of conformity with a market system are derived. The concrete application of these rules leads to recommendations for a policy of sustainability with respect to the setting of goals, the establishment of institutions as well as the use of appropriate instruments.

Is environmental degradation an inevitable consequence of economic growth: tunneling through the environmental Kuznets curve	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Economywide reforms often contribute simultaneously to economic, social and environmental gains. However, Unintended adverse side effects occur in many cases-when such growth inducing reforms are undertaken while neglecting other policy, market or institutional imperfections. The remedy does not generally require reversal of the original economywide reforms, but rather the ex-ante implementation of additional complementary measures that remove such imperfections. The EKC approach seeks to relate the state of the environment to the stage of development. Developing countries could learn from the experiences of industrialized nations, and restructure growth and development to 'tunnel' through any potential EKC-thereby avoiding going through the same stages of growth that involve relatively high (and even irreversible) levels of environmental harm. An environmentally adjusted measure of national income could significantly change the shape of the development-environment relationship. Recommendations for decision-making include: actively seeking 'win-win' policies that simultaneously yield both economic and environmental gains; pre-empting environmental harm through ex-ante remedial measures; and fine-tuning reform policies to avoid severe environmental damage. The adoption of more sustainable policies will facilitate the attainment of higher levels of development at a lower environmental cost.	Mohan Munasinghe
Richer and cleaner? A study on carbon dioxide emissions in developing countries	Energy Policy	1999	01	01	The climate change debate has drawn attention to the problem of greenhouse gases emissions into the atmosphere. One of the most important issues in the policy debate is the role that should be played by developing countries in joining the commitment of developed countries to reduce GHG emissions, and particularly CO2 emissions. This debate calls into play the relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions and economic development. In this paper we use a panel data model for 110 world countries to estimate the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP and to produce emission forecast. The paper contains three major results: (i) the empirical relationship between carbon dioxide and income is well described by non-linear Gamma and Weibull specifications as opposed to more usual linear and log-linear functional forms; (ii) our single equation reduced form model is comparable in terms of forecasted emissions with other more complex, less data driven models; (iii) despite the decreasing marginal propensity to pollute, our forecasts show that future global emissions will rise. The average world growth of CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2020 is about 2.2%/yr, while that of non-Annex 1 countries is posted at 3.3%/yr.	Marzio Galeotti, Alessandro Lanza

Economic incentives for sustainable management: a small optimal control model for tropical forestry	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The main purpose of this article is to evaluate different policy options for promoting low-impact logging through the use of economic incentives. To do this we construct a small optimal control theory model within an integrated framework including both the biological and the economic implications of timber extraction. The approach uses detailed stock, yield and cost data from Ghana. A numerical solution is reached by the use of multi-period non-linear optimisation. Direct subsidies to low-impact logging activities through area-dependent subsidies is found to be far more efficient than subsidising prices of tropical timber. The model takes a novel approach in combining growth and stock in a tropical forest area with the cost and damage connected with timber extraction. It allows us to analyse the interactions between stock, growth, timber extraction, logging damage and operating costs in an integrated manner.	Christian Friis Bach
Globalisation, transport and the environment: new perspectives for ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This article aims to offer an overview of key issues centred around the relationship between globalisation and transport-related environmental decay in the ecological economics literature of the past decade, followed by an exploration of new research endeavours. The scientific contribution of 10 years of Ecological Economics to issues of environmental sustainability in relation to international trade and transport is certainly not impressive. Hence, also contributions from other environmental economics journals are considered. Two themes which apparently have received less attention in the ecological economics literature are addressed, namely (1) the influence of global trade on the environment and (2) the environmental effects of international transport induced by trade. The total effect of globalisation and transportation on the environment originates from complex changes in the scale, structural, technological and product effects of our industrial system. Various conflicts between global trade/transportation and the environment are pointed out on the basis of these four effects. The paper argues that the net effects of these changes are still uncertain. Ecological economics, however, should contribute to the challenging task of analysing more thoroughly the effects of global trade and transport on the environment.

Why the WTA-WTP disparity matters	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The disparity between willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept compensation (WTA) has been demonstrated repeatedly. Because using WTP estimates of value where a WTA estimate is appropriate tends to undervalue environmental assets, this issue is important to environmental managers. We summarize reasons for the disparity and then discuss some of the implications for management of environmental assets. We end by suggesting some approaches for dealing with the lack of credible methods for estimating WTA values of environmental goods.	Thomas C Brown, Robin Gregory
Costing an international public good: the case of the Baltic Sea	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The paper discusses an economically efficient and internationally equitable provision of a specific public good. The good in question, the Baltic Sea, satisfies a number of needs, but economic values implied may be different in various countries polluting and using the Sea. The level of eutrophication has been identified as a key characteristic of the Baltic Sea relevant for its value. The Chander-Tulkens model of cost-sharing is used to determine a hypothetical allocation of abatement costs across the countries around the sea. The application of the model is based on estimates of national abatement costs as well as national willingness to pay for reduced eutrophication. Estimating willingness to pay in a collection of countries (some of which undergo a transition from centrally planned systems) has been the main challenge of this study. The results were derived from a coordinated series of contingent valuation surveys in Lithuania, Poland and Sweden, combined with benefit transfer studies to cover the rest of the region. Predictions of cost-sharing schemes obtained from the Chander-Tulkens model are confronted with actual data on abatement expenditures and international assistance. Several recommendations on how to optimize the Baltic-wide programmes conclude the paper.	Agnieszka Markowska, Tomasz ≈ªylicz
An interindustry approach to analyzing economic and environmental effects of the recycling of waste	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Recycling of waste reduces the demand for virgin materials, the amount of waste to be incinerated and/or landfilled, and also reduces emissions from these sources, however, it generates waste and emissions of its own. This paper presents a static inter-industry model for analyzing economic and environmental effects of the recycling of waste that is capable of accommodating these aspects of recycling. Waste can be classified into two major categories depending on the way it is generated: (1) those generated as 'undesired' by-products in the production process such as wastewater or sludge, and (2) those originally produced as goods but have turned to waste with the passing of time, such as old paper or discarded consumer durables. We are concerned with the second category of waste. This category of waste tends to be distributed over a wide geographical area because it is generated in the place of final use, whereas the first one is generated in the place of production. Since the issue of sorted collection will thus be a non-negligible element of any recycling program involving this category of waste, we treat the collection and recycling of waste as distinct activities, instead of their being put into a black box. In this respect, our model is an extension of Duchin, 1990, Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, 1, 243-262. We regard the amount of waste as a given stock, and do not consider the process of its generation. As an empirical illustration, we construct a numerical example for the recycling of old paper based on the Dutch NAMEA data for 1992, and analyze effects of alternative recycling scenarios on the industrial activity and emission of CO2. Each scenario consists of a set of parameters referring to the proportion of recycled goods in total input, the efficiency of waste collection, and the efficiency of recycling technology.

Can solar cooking save the forests?	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Cooking with the sun has become a potentially viable substitute for fuelwood in food preparation in much of the developing world. Fuelwood scarcity is a growing problem that has thus far been poorly addressed. Solar cooking is one possible solution but its acceptance has been limited partially due to cultural barriers, relatively high start-up costs, and a lack of continued support subsequent to introduction. One possible source of some funding for solar cookers may be the Clean Development Mechanism (Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocols) aimed at reducing carbon emissions to curtail the impact of global warming. Using Haiti as an example, CDM funding is shown to be promising but only a partial solution. With CDM as a possible source of at least seed capital, more ambitious solar cooking programs are feasible but their success will be a function of addressing cultural barriers and providing support for adaptation well beyond the introductory stage.

Non-renewability in forest rotations: implications for economic and ecosystem sustainability	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The forest rotations problem has been considered by generations of economists (Fisher, 1930; Boulding, 1966; Samuelson, 1976). Traditionally, the forest resource across all future harvest periods is assumed to grow without memory of past harvest periods. This paper integrates economic theory and intertemporal ecological mechanics, linking current harvest decisions with future forest growth, financial value, and ecosystem health. Results and implications of a non-renewable forest resource and the influence of rotation length and number on forest recovery are reported. Cost estimates of moving from short-term economic rotations to long-term ecological rotations suggest the level of incentive required for one aspect of ecosystem management. A net private cost of maintaining ecosystem health emerges and, for public policy purposes, can be compared with measures of non-timber amenity values and social benefits exhibiting increasing returns to rotation length.

The second law, the fourth law, recycling and limits to growth	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Despite counter examples in nature, it has been argued that total recycling is impossible for an industrial society as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. In this paper it is shown that there is no such limitation. However, it is also shown that there must be a large stockpile of inactive materials as well as an exogenous source of exergy (e.g. from the sun) for a stable steady-state recycling system to function. The paper also discusses (briefly) some of the implications for economic growth.	Robert U Ayres
Alleviating soil erosion/pollution stock externalities: alternative roles for government	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper addresses two temporal externalities due to agriculture: soil erosion and related pollution. The possibility of decentralization of decisions, the appropriate role of a resource manager, and the efficiency of alternative policies are examined using traditional welfare economics concepts for a two-sector model of rural-urban linkage. Three alternative types of policies can be socially efficient, but imply different involvement by government, and have different knowledge requirements. A Pigouvian policy requires full information. A bargaining solution involves government only in setting an entitlement, but it may require too much knowledge by rural households in terms of understanding dynamic environmental relationships. A third way is that government and rural households be co-producers of environmental goods. This concept assigns government the responsibility for maintaining knowledge about environmental relationships, and government is a participant in a market system that determines prices for environmental-related goods.

Advancing ecology and economics through a business-science synthesis	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper provides an overview of the concept of sustainability, presents our definition of sustainability, and contends that students need to have exposure to both business and scientific perspectives as undergraduates. We argue that the typical university class may be ineffective in conveying the scope of changes now taking place in the business world, and offer our pedagogic innovations as an alternative to the status quo. The result is a capstone course in sustainability team taught by one professor from the School of Business and one from the College of Arts and Science. The intended audience for the course is undergraduate students majoring in business or science. The content draws heavily on the many parallels between ecology and economics, including systems and resilience, ethics and valuation issues, and information and dialogue as central to the process of sustainability.

Measuring sustainability: A time series of alternative indicators for Scotland	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper presents results from a time-series analysis of seven alternative measures of sustainability for Scotland. The measures chosen are green Net National Product, genuine savings, ecological footprint, environmental space, net primary productivity, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare and the Genuine Progress Indicator. These are all measures at the national, or macro, level. We note arguments in the literature that no one single measure of 'sustainability' is likely to be sufficient. However, very different messages concerning the sustainability of Scotland over the period in question (1980-1993) emerge from these measures chosen. We also argue that different indicators provide different insights for policy making.	Nick Hanley, Ian Moffatt, Robin Faichney, Mike Wilson
Green accounting for a sustainable economy	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Statisticians avoid getting involved in data analysis, leaving data users on their own in interpreting the results of their work. This is particularly unfortunate in a new area of applied statistics such as environmental accounting with which few are really familiar. Earlier this year data producers and users explored, in a national seminar, possible policy applications of the results of a 'green accounting' project in the Philippines. The main findings of the author's contribution to the seminar, on which the present paper is based, are that environmental accounts: (1) present evidence of sustainable economic performance in the country during the relatively short-time period of 1988-1994; (2) provide information for environmental cost internalization; (3) may guide investment to environmentally sound production processes; (4) help to specify and monitor policies of natural wealth conservation, distribution and management; and (5) reveal major data gaps. The paper concludes that environmental accounts help to assess the sustainability of economic growth in terms of broadly defined capital maintenance. The sustainability of development, however, would have to be measured by alternative or supplementary physical indicators linked to quantifiable standards or targets.	Peter Bartelmus
Global warming: discounting is not the issue, but substitutability is	Energy Policy	1999	01	01	The cost-benefit study of Nordhaus (1994) is representative for the neoclassical approach towards global warming. Nordhaus found that no substantial emission cuts are warranted. Most of his critics have concentrated on the issue of discounting and demanded that a lower discount rate should be applied. These criticisms first miss the point and second lead to ethically dubious, inconsistent conclusions and inefficient policy choices. They miss the point because the real problem of Nordhaus's methodology is his implicit underlying assumption of perfect substitutability between natural and other forms of capital. Given the validity of this assumption, lowering the rate of discount is inconsistent with current savings behaviour, is ethically dubious because future generations will be much richer than the current one anyway, and is inefficient because scarce financial resources are channelled into emissions abatement that exhibits rates of return far inferior to alternative public investments. Any call for aggressive emission abatement must therefore directly attack the perfect substitutability assumption of neoclassical economics. The real disagreement is about whether consumption growth can compensate for environmental degradation caused by global warming. Discounting is not the issue, but substitutability is.	Eric Neumayer
Alternative scenarios of social development: is analytical sustainability policy analysis possible? How?	Sustainable Development	1999	01	01	In the article some alternative scenarios of social development are presented and discussed in detail. The following scenarios are discussed: (i) the Deep Ecology Scenario, (ii) the Strong Sustainable Development Scenario, (iii) the Weak Sustainable Development Scenario, (iv) the Boomsday Scenario, (v) the Doomsday Scenario and (vi) the World Bank 'Policy Tunnel' Scenario. In the article it is noted that the environmental EKC hypothesis can be connected theoretically to the Boomsday Scenario and loosely to the World Bank 'Policy Tunnel' Scenario. On the basis of scenario analysis, it is pointed out that sustainable development is not a conflict-free concept because the criteria of sustainability (environmental sustainability, economic efficiency and social equality) cannot be simultaneously met in most of the scenarios analysed. Global strategies that are based on the general, simple concepts of sustainability can be even harmful for developing societies. A useful approach for the sustainable development policy formation is sustainability thinking that is based on the analytical positioning of the current situation. The strategic guidelines of the new positioning framework are presented in the article. On the basis of theory-based scenario analysis it is noted that the situation-based framework may help international development agencies, as well as well national and local governments, in the formation of analytical environmental policy strategies.

The first decade of Ecological Economics	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This issue marks the 10th anniversary of the publication of Ecological Economics. As we begin our second decade, it is an appropriate time to look back and assess what we have done over the first decade, and to set the course for the next one. Have we met the goals we set for ourselves 10 years ago? If not, what can we do to improve? This paper reiterates the goals of Ecological Economics, discusses our editorial policy and agenda, provides an assessment of what we have published in the first decade (including some quantitative information), and suggests some future directions.

Uncertainty, risk aversion, and the game theoretic foundations of the safe minimum standard: a reassessment	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Contrary to a widely-held perception, game theory can provide a consistent and rigorous economic justification for the safe minimum standard (SMS) constraint on economic development. S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup (1968) based the SMS on the idea that risk-aversion is an important public policy motive, and Richard Bishop (1978) tried to theoretically justify this idea 20 years ago by applying the minimax decision rule to an insurance (loss avoidance) game-theoretic model. More recently Richard Ready and Bishop (1991) distinguished two different games against nature and determined that the minimax rule implied opposite choices (for preservation, for development) in the models and, therefore, game theory could not provide a consistent rationale for the SMS. Ready and Bishop's two games can be viewed as subgames of a more comprehensive dynamic game of society against nature. The minimax decision rule yields contrary results because the two subgames embody different kinds of uncertainty. Further, the minimax rule both ignores the social cost of wrong choices and violates Milnor's bonus invariance axiom for game-theoretic decision rules (Milnor, J., 1964). A minimax-regret decision rule is preferred because it emphasizes risk-aversion while explicitly incorporating the opportunity cost of making a 'wrong' choice between preservation and development. The rule gives rise to a consistent choice of preservation over both the insurance and lottery games and transfers the burden of argument from preservationists to developers. On the other hand, the SMS constraint on development is contingent on the size of development benefits foregone and thus is not absolute and binding.	Dennis Palmini
Trust law, sustainability, and responsible action	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The problem of managing for sustainability is marked by the need to make decisions on behalf of others and by the uncertainties that attend such decisions. However, the economic literature on sustainability has paid scant attention to how decisions on behalf of others might differ from decisions on behalf of oneself. And, when risk has been modeled explicitly, the expected utility hypothesis has generally been used: a generation acts sustainably if the expected value of the next generation's utility is not less than the present's. This paper investigates how we think about responsibly acting on another's behalf by looking to the United States law of trusts because in important respects the current generation views its responsibility to the future as a trust relationship. Trust law illuminates responsible decision making under both risk and uncertainty. Even under conditions of risk more conservative action than would be suggested by the expected utility hypothesis is warranted. Because it emphasizes preservation of trust principal and disavows profit maximization, trust doctrine indicates that special caution should be exercised in conditions of uncertainty. Finally, resource economic concepts of strong sustainability, the precautionary principle, and the safe minimum standard of conservation are interpreted according to trust principles.	Antony Scott
A dynamic approach to the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis states that pollution levels increase as a country develops, but begin to decrease as rising incomes pass beyond a turning point. In EKC analyses, the relationship between environmental degradation and income is usually expressed as a quadratic function with the turning point occurring at a maximum pollution level. Other explanatory variables have been included in these models, but income regularly has had the most significant effect on indicators of environmental quality. One variable consistently omitted in these relationships is the price of energy. This paper analyzes previous models to illustrate the importance of prices in these models and then includes prices in an econometric EKC framework testing energy/income and CO2/income relationships. These long-run price/income models find that income is no longer the most relevant indicator of environmental quality or energy demand. Indeed, we find no significant evidence for the existence of an EKC within the range of current incomes for energy in the presence of price and trade variables.	Jean Agras, Duane Chapman
Legal institutions, environmental protection, and the willingness-to-accept measure of value	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper looks at the US legal system and negative environmental externalities. I provide a positive explanation for the role of courts in environmental disputes using the willingness-to-accept (WA) measure of value. I further suggest that environmental law has aided courts in attaining a new welfare standard, WA-efficiency. The explanation offered here contrasts with those found in Law and Economics because I propose that courts are not substitutes for markets and, as such, one of their important roles may be to efficiently redistribute entitlements. The analysis is formalized with a model in which the court allows a victim of pollution to exert a credible threat against a polluter, which results in increased social welfare-even beyond what would exist in a zero transaction cost world. I also investigate when legal policy based on WA-efficiency is appropriate, and suggest that the answer may hinge on Rawl's notion of primary goods.	Lanse Minkler

Natural Resource and Environmental Economics: A Retrospective View	Review of Agricultural Economics	1999	01	01	This article reviews the methodological and theoretical foundations of natural resource and environmental economics prior to an examination of three examples of topics of current interest in the field. The three examples are nonmarket values, benefit-cost analysis, and the new institutional economics. The article draws on the review of contemporary work to identify a number of topics deserving of attention in subsequent work in this field. The items listed would have the effect of making future research more particular and less doctrinaire.	Emery N. Castle
Henry Carey's Political-Ecological Economics	Organization & Environment	1999	01	01	Henry Carey was the most important American economist of the middle part of the 19th century. Although he lacked an academic following in the United States, he was influential in Europe. In the course of denouncing British trade policy and British political economy, Carey developed an ecological-economic analysis that prefigures much modern thought. Carey began with the dangers of soil depletion and developed a dynamic theory of value based on the cost of reproduction. He called for a development strategy based on the complete, local recycling of all goods, including even waste products from both animate and inanimate sources. This article details the strengths and shortcomings of Carey's work. Although Carey was quite conservative and trusted in markets, his theories point in the direction of a radical ecological-economic program.	Michael Perelman
Multiple attribute decision analysis for ecosystem management	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Implementation of an ecosystem approach to natural resource management requires evaluation of a broad array of ecological services in a multidimensional, community-based watershed approach that empowers people to make informed management decisions. Conventional economic approaches that assign values to ecological services (contingent valuation) or that evaluate the efficiency of preserving and restoring those services (cost-benefit analysis) are quite limited for this purpose. In addition to the methodological difficulties encountered in applying contingent valuation and cost-benefit analysis, several problems occur when nonmarket values of ecological services are estimated independently of ecosystem planning and management. Multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) is an alternative conceptual framework for evaluating and selecting land and water resource management systems (LWRMS). Advantages of MADM are that it facilitates community-based collaborative decision-making, avoids some of the ethical, theoretical and practical shortcomings of conventional economic approaches, does not require assigning monetary values to ecological services, allows consideration of multiple attributes and is not culturally biased. The MADM model described in this paper explains how a property manager selects the most preferred LWRMS for a property based on their multiple stochastic attributes. Application of the model requires determination of the technically feasible LWRMS for a property and specification of the socially acceptable ranges of attributes. This information is combined with economic/biophysical simulations to derive the efficient combination of attributes and LWRMS for a property. The property manager then selects the most preferred combination of attributes from the efficient combinations of attributes for a property using utility maximization, surrogate worth tradeoff, free iterative search, analytical hierarchy process, Aspiration-Reservation Based Decision Support System or stochastic dominance. A watershed alliance can evaluate the sustainability of the most preferred LWRMS for properties in a watershed based on a weak or strong sustainability criterion. If the alliance determines that the most preferred LWRMS are not sustainable, then an index of attributes is used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of alternative public policies for stimulating the adoption of more sustainable LWRMS.

Ecological economics and sustainable governance of the oceans	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This paper is an introduction and synthesis of the papers that appear in this special issue devoted to the sustainable governance of the oceans. The special issue contains papers on various aspects of the problem, including: the ecological and economic importance of the oceans, the problems facing the oceans from an ecological economics perspective, the links between science and policy, the rationale for sustainable ocean governance, and examples of sustainable institutions and governance structures. We developed the 'Lisbon principles' of sustainable governance (responsibility, scale-matching, precaution, adaptive management, full cost allocation, and participation) as a core set of guidelines for sustainable ocean governance. We then describe the major problems facing the oceans in terms of how the principles are violated, and evaluate some suggested institutions in terms of how the principles are incorporated.

Public preferences and willingness-to-pay for nature conservation in the North York Moors National Park, UK	Journal of Environmental Management	1999	01	01	"In the light of decreased Central Government funding, National Parks and protected areas throughout the world will have to increasingly ""pay for themselves"", depending to a greater extent on revenue from tourism, the sale of proceeds and/or external grants. Public preferences and broader economic values are therefore likely to play an increasingly important role in the management of such environmental resources. The purpose of this work was to use an environmental economics framework to estimate public preferences for different habitats within the North York Moors National Park, UK, and the economic value associated with National Parks in the UK. Both heather moorland and semi-natural broadleaved woodland were highly valued by visitors to the Park, moorland primarily for recreation and woodland primarily for nature conservation. Contingent valuation revealed that whilst some people thought that increased revenue for the National Park should be raised by the Park itself by making more productive use of the land, a significant majority of visitors said they would be prepared to contribute additional revenue towards nature conservation in the National Park. A postal questionnaire revealed that this amounted to a mean value of 3*10 per individual per year. This compared with 119 per individual per year for all 11 National Parks obtained from an interview questionnaire. The results indicate that most visitors to the Park would be willing to provide additional revenue towards nature conservation, and that recreation in the Park could therefore be used in a beneficial way to maintain and enhance the Park's nature conservation value."

Spatial sustainability, trade and indicators: an evaluation of the 'ecological footprint'	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The search for frameworks and indicators of sustainable development has taken a prominent place in this journal. However, some specific aspects have received little or no attention, notably the spatial dimension and the role of international trade in indicator development. Moreover, many sustainable development indicators comprise implicit valuations, weighting schemes and policy objectives, which are insufficiently recognised as such. This contribution tries to highlight these issues by means of a review of a recently proposed indicator for ecological-economic analysis, namely the ecological footprint, that has been developed by Wackernagel and Rees. Its concept and calculation procedure are criticised on a number of points, and it is concluded that the Ecological Footprint is not the comprehensive and transparent planning tool as is often assumed. In explaining our position we will argue that spatial sustainability and regional sustainable development have not been precisely discussed so far, neither in the literature on trade and environment, nor in that on sustainable development. We will defend the view that trade can contribute positively and negatively to environmental unsustainability. Consequently, indicators and models are needed that allow for analysing interactions and trade-offs between such opposite effects.	Jeroen C.J.M van den Bergh, Harmen Verbruggen
New directions in emissions trading: the potential contribution of new institutional economics	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Once an arcane topic even among environmental economists, emissions trading systems have substantially increased during this past decade in the USA. Moreover, the implementation of these systems has necessitated increased involvement of professionals in many fields besides economics. This paper reviews the practical experience of the six major types of emissions trading systems, focusing on credit market development, participation and results, including transaction costs. Five more recent applications of emissions trading also are considered, as well as the possibility of inter-pollutant trading. While inter-pollutant trading has been successfully used for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the applicability of this experience is probably very limited. Additionally, it would be highly premature to attempt an evaluation of these newer emissions trading systems, some of which have yet to be even partially implemented. In order to improve these latter and future programs, the paper considers the potential contribution of the New Institutional Economics (NIE) to emissions trading. The NIE is used to develop theoretical insights and a series of predictions about the performance of a range of emissions trading systems.	Barry D Solomon
Limits to growth, sustainable development and environmental kuznets curves: an examination of the environmental impact of economic development	Sustainable Development	1999	01	01	The nature of the relationship between economic development and the environment has been discussed since the 1960s, yet opinion remains divided. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation and begins by reviewing the largely theoretical discussions from the 'limits to growth' debate of the 1970s to the advent of sustainable development in the 1980s. The paper then examines the recent studies that have subjected the growth - environment relationship to a statistical analysis through the estimation of environmental Kuznets curves (EKCs). The extent to which these studies indicate a decoupling of environmental damage from growth is considered and reasons are suggested why some environmental indicators appear to improve with growth whilst others deteriorate. In order to illustrate the need to interpret EKCs carefully, forecasts of global emissions are made, for the period 1990-2020, for two pollutants that EKCs suggest are being decoupled from economic growth. Policy implications are then discussed. Copyright ¬© 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.	Matthew A. Cole

Values, ideology and politics in ecological economics	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	Ecological economics is built on a value-commitment to study environmental issues and to contribute constructively to a more sustainable development path. However, many ecological economists still hesitate, it appears, to depart too much from other scholars by openly addressing issues of values and ideology. In this essay, the role of the scholar's orientation with respect to values and ideology is addressed. It is observed that not only scholars but also actors in society are guided by their 'ideological orientation'. This leads to the idea that some of the weaknesses of Economic Man and 'profit maximising firm' assumptions can be mitigated by introducing a Political Economic Person and a Political Economic Organisation.

On Interdisciplinary Research: with particular reference to the field of environment and development	Higher Education Quarterly	1999	01	01	Interdisciplinary research is fashionable, but also controversial; yet it is far from agreed what is meant by the term. This paper analyses some central issues concerning interdisciplinary research, both in general and with particular reference to the field of environment and development. It draws on earlier literature, especially Becher (1989) and on experience from universities in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, U.S.A and Britain. The paper includes an analysis of how disciplines interact, focussing on economics, ecology and anthropology. It also addresses two 'great divides'. The first is that between the 'two cultures': a gap which is indeed important, although it does not lie precisely between the natural sciences on the one hand and the social sciences and humanities on the other. The second is the gap between research and application; research that is usable by policy-makers, it is argued, is typically, and necessarily, not of high quality judged in academic terms.

Post-normal science and the rhetoric of inquiry: deconstructing normal science?	Futures	1999	01	01	Post-normal science is an attempt to increase the problem-solving capacity of scientific work in a context of 'soft' scientific inputs and 'hard' policy decisions. The discourse on rhetoric in science can contribute to a better understanding of the problems and potentials of such an effort. The inclusion of 'extended peer communities' is a case in point of the usefulness of rhetoric for an enterprise that wants to go beyond the normal science of puzzle-solving. The critical potential of rhetoric should be utilized. The distinction between internal and external rhetoric highlights the problematic relationship between scientific and political work, for example in the field of environmental issues.	Fred Luks
Ecological restructuring for sustainable development: evidence from the Australian economy	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	The possibility of reconciliation between economic growth and environmental quality has been foreshadowed by several influential reports over the last decade. The potential basis for reconciliation lies in delinking economic growth from material and energy throughput, especially through ecological restructuring toward modes of production, consumption and trade which are less environmentally intensive. So far, empirical studies of delinking and ecological restructuring have shown conditional improvements in a small number of industrialized countries-mostly high-income European economies. However, there are reasons to believe that the situation may vary in natural resource-based economies (such as Australia) due to differences in trade and economic structures and incentives. Achieving (global) sustainable development will hinge upon prospects for ecological restructuring in all nations. Some of the central concepts of ecological restructuring are reviewed and extended to an empirical search for signs of delinking in Australia. To do this, time series trends in physical quantities of seven environmentally significant factors are examined (i.e. energy, freight, cement, paper, steel, aluminium and plastic). The factors serve as proxies for economic activity of a particularly environmentally intensive nature. Three dimensions are analyzed: material-intensity, absolute throughput, and per capita throughput. The results show that promising trends in the 1980s have not persisted in the face of relatively high population growth and economic growth. Some implications for ecological restructuring as a basis for sustainable development in natural resource-based economies are discussed in light of evidence from Australia.	T. Picton, P.L. Daniels
Inequality, Resource Depletion, and Welfare Accounting: Applications to Indonesia and Costa Rica	World Development	1999	01	01	Ahluwalia and Chenery noted that the standard measures of GDP growth imply distributional weights that place greater weight on the income of richer income groups, and proposed distribution-neutral and pro-poor alternatives. More recently, pilot studies by the World Resources Institute (WRI) have questioned the sustainability of GDP growth and have introduced natural resource modifications to national income accounting. To date, no studies have undertaken both revisions concurrently, creating a revised measure based on GDP but corrected for both distributional bias and resource depletion. Such a measure is derived in this paper, and its impact illustrated with data from Indonesia and Costa Rica, the countries studied by the WRI.	Mariano Torras
Linking Nature's services to ecosystems: some general ecological concepts	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	I present a selected review of ecological concepts that are important for understanding how nature's services are linked to their support system, the ecosystem. The paper is mainly aimed at an audience of non-biologists to facilitate cooperation among disciplines. A list of services compiled from the literature is classified according to ecological criteria that relate to the properties of the services. These criteria are: (1) if the goods or services are produced and maintained within the ecosystem or shared with other ecosystems; (2) if the goods or object of the service are living or inorganic material; and (3) what biological unit is associated with production and maintenance, i.e. an individual, a species, a group of species, an entire community, the ecosystem, the landscape or on a global scale. Using these criteria I have identified and selected three major groups of ecosystem services for which some common ecological concepts apply. These are: (1) the maintenance of populations; (2) the use of ecosystems as filters of externally imposed compounds; and (3) the property of biological units to create organization through selective processes. These three categories are examined and exemplified in detail.	Jon Norberg
Ecological goods and services of coral reef ecosystems	Ecological Economics	1999	01	01	This article identifies ecological goods and services of coral reef ecosystems, with special emphasis on how they are generated. Goods are divided into renewable resources and reef mining. Ecological services are classified into physical structure services, biotic services, biogeochemical services, information services, and social/cultural services. A review of economic valuation studies reveals that only a few of the goods and services of reefs have been captured. We synthesize current understanding of the relationships between ecological services and functional groups of species and biological communities of coral reefs in different regions of the world. The consequences of human impacts on coral reefs are also discussed, including loss of resilience, or buffer capacity. Such loss may impair the capacity for recovery of coral reefs and as a consequence the quality and quantity of their delivery of ecological goods and services. Conserving the capacity of reefs to generate essential services requires that they are managed as components of a larger seascape-landscape of which human activities are seen as integrated parts.

Economics of charcoal production in miombo woodlands of eastern Tanzania: some hidden costs associated with commercialization of the resources	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	This paper assigns monetary values to commercial production of charcoal (using traditional earth kilns) in the miombo woodlands surrounding Kitulanghalo Forest Reserve in eastern Tanzania, through cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Charcoal is the most commercialised resource in the study area and the net present value (NPV) for the charcoal business over a 15-year period was US$ 511 ha-1. The profit from charcoal production is attributable to very low capital outlays, 'free' own labour, 'free' raw materials, lack of concern about associated external costs and high demand for charcoal. When the cost of labour, raw materials and opportunity costs were considered, the NPV value was negative (US$ -868 ha-1), indicating that profit realization is accomplished at the expense of other potential uses of the woodlands. The estimated local wood consumption for charcoal of 6.01 m3 capita-1 year-1 is very high compared to subsistence firewood consumption of 1.5 m3 capita-1 year-1. The estimated area cleared for charcoal production locally was 1671 ha year-1, which was about 13% of surrounding easily accessible communal woodlands in the area (<5 km from settlements and <10 km from the Dar-es-Salaam-Morogoro highway), which were estimated to cover 13 350 ha. This shows that although commercialisation of wood resources provides tangible monetary benefits to rural communities, it also contributes to the resource depletion that will ultimately threaten their long-term survival. We recommend some policy interventions in order to safeguard the resources.	E.J Luoga, E.T.F Witkowski, K Balkwill
A simple bioeconomic model of a marine reserve	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	We model the effect of a no-take reserve in a marine fishery management area, such as on a coral reef. Implicitly, eggs and larvae are mobile but adults are not; and there is open access fishing outside the reserve. A reserve is found to increase equilibrium catch if the prior ratio of stock to carrying capacity is less than a half, and the catch-maximising reserve proportion rises towards a half as this ratio falls towards zero. After initial adjustment, long-run stability is improved by a reserve. We estimate that coral reef reserves could increase world wide annual catches by about a billion dollars.

Easter Island: historical anecdote or warning for the future?	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Two standard solutions for the 'Malthusian Trap' involve institutional reforms and technological progress. Using Easter Island as an example, we investigate the hypothetical role that technological progress and population management reform might have played in preventing the collapse of the island's civilization. The model includes a composite manufactured good and a composite harvested renewable resource. Fertility is assumed to rise with per capita income. The resource's carrying capacity and intrinsic growth rate as well as labor's harvesting productivity are subject to technological progress. Fertility is subject to population management reform. The model yields a system of two simultaneous, nonlinear, non-autonomous differential equations. We first study the system's steady states. The system is then parameterized for Easter Island and its comparative dynamics are investigated in simulations. We find that technological progress can generate large fluctuations in population, renewable resources, and per capita utility, sometimes resulting in system collapse. With high fertility rates, the population and the resource vanish. None of the simulations investigated here exhibit a constantly growing per capita utility over time. Finally, we evaluate the applicability of these results to contemporary societies.	Rafael Reuveny, Christopher S. Decker
Moral dimensions of the WTA-WTP disparity: an experimental examination	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Contrary to welfare economic theory, empirical evidence suggests that the amount of money people are willing-to-accept (WTA) to forego a commodity will generally exceed the amount of money they are willing-to-pay (WTP) to gain the commodity. This paper undertakes an experimental examination of the WTA-WTP disparity using conventional and ecologically produced eggs. The results of this experiment reveal that the difference between the mean WTP and WTA for conventional eggs is negligible while the mean WTA is more than 1.5 times higher than the mean WTP in the case of ecological eggs. An explanation for this result is offered following the Boyce et al. (Boyce, R.B., Brown, T.C., McClelland, G.H., Peterson, G.L., Schulze, W.D., 1992. An experimental examination of intrinsic values as a source of the WTA-WTP disparity. Am. Econ. Rev. 82, 1366-1373) notion that an asymmetrical assignment of moral responsibility may cause WTA to exceed WTP. By comparing the two studies, a tentative conclusion is that the valuation disparity is likely to increase with a corresponding increase in the degree of assigned moral responsibility.

"""I struggled with this money business"": respondents' perspectives on contingent valuation"	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	In the long-running debates about the validity and legitimacy of contingent valuation (CV), very little research has engaged directly with respondents during or after the survey to explore what individuals' willingness to pay (WTP) figure meant. This paper presents the results of qualitative research with respondents to a CV survey carried out as part of the appraisal of a specific nature conservation policy in the UK. The results show that respondents' questioned the validity of their WTP figures through discussion of the difficulties they experienced in framing a meaningful reply. Significant difficulties included problems in contextualising what the scheme was and how much it might be worth in both monetary and non-monetary terms; an inability to work out a value for one scheme in isolation from others in other parts of the UK; and feelings that values for nature were not commensurable with monetary valuation. Turning to the legitimacy of CV, participants in the research challenged claims that CV is a democratic process for ensuring that public values are incorporated in policy decisions. Recognizing that hard economic choices have to be made in order to achieve nature conservation goals, participants argued for a decision-making institution where local people could contribute to environmental policy decisions through dialogue with scientists and policy-makers. In the final part of the paper, this project is compared with three studies that have also used qualitative approaches with respondents during and/or after a CV survey. The paper concludes that more context-specific, qualitative research with respondents is needed to explore further the conclusion that CV may not be a good methodology for capturing complex, cultural values for nature and landscape.

Ecological-economic analysis of wetlands: scientific integration for management and policy	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Wetlands all over the world have been lost or are threatened in spite of various international agreements and national policies. This is caused by: (1) the public nature of many wetlands products and services; (2) user externalities imposed on other stakeholders; and (3) policy intervention failures that are due to a lack of consistency among government policies in different areas (economics, environment, nature protection, physical planning, etc.). All three causes are related to information failures which in turn can be linked to the complexity and 'invisibility' of spatial relationships among groundwater, surface water and wetland vegetation. Integrated wetland research combining social and natural sciences can help in part to solve the information failure to achieve the required consistency across various government policies. An integrated wetland research framework suggests that a combination of economic valuation, integrated modelling, stakeholder analysis, and multi-criteria evaluation can provide complementary insights into sustainable and welfare-optimising wetland management and policy. Subsequently, each of the various components of such integrated wetland research is reviewed and related to wetland management policy.

Environmental value transfer: state of the art and future prospects	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	The main objectives of the paper are to (1) give an overview of the state of the art of environmental value transfer, (2) discuss its prospects and potential role in CBA as a decision-support tool, and (3) provide further guidelines for proper use and application. Environmental value or benefit transfer is a technique in which the results of studies on monetary environmental valuation are applied to new policy contexts. The technique is controversial, not least because of academic and political reservations over the usefulness and technical feasibility of economic valuation tools to demonstrate the importance of environmental values in project or programme appraisals. Testing of environmental value transfer so far has been unable to validate the practice. Taking into account the conditions set out in the literature for valid and reliable value transfer, most transfers appear to result in substantial transfer errors. This paper discusses why and addresses the question of which factors may have been overlooked. It is argued that the problem is much more fundamental than previously acknowledged. Strict guidelines in terms of quantitative adjustment mechanisms to valid value transfer are meaningless if the more fundamental issue of differences in the very nature of the values elicited is not addressed at the same time.

Sustainability assessment of development scenarios: methodology and application to Thailand	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	This paper aims to offer an applicable evaluation framework for assessing sustainable development strategies at the regional level, with a particular view on the treatment of uncertain information. After a survey of various regional sustainable development studies, several methodological issues pertaining to regional sustainability are presented and discussed, which lay the foundation for the central approach in this paper, viz. the use of critical threshold values. Based on a multidimensional indicator system, a systematic multicriteria model is proposed by employing the recently developed and user-friendly flag model. This model is able to take into consideration various relevant classes of (non) compliance with critical threshold values. By means of this model an empirical case study is undertaken for the Songkhla/Hat Yai area in southern Thailand. Three policy scenario's (decentralization, sectoral and regional promotion and environmental protection) are systematically evaluated using a blend of the above-mentioned critical threshold value and the flag approach. It is concluded that in general the decentralization policy is slightly more preferable than the sectoral and regional development scenario and significantly more preferable than the environmental protection scenario for the region concerned. The analytical tools used (a qualitative systems approach, the use of critical threshold values and the flag model) appeared to yield a satisfactory contribution to sustainability assessment, even in case of qualitative information.

Alternative models of individual behaviour and implications for environmental policy	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Most insights of environmental economics are in line with the standard neoclassical economic model of rational behaviour, formulated in terms of maximization of utility in general, or of profits in particular. The standard theory of environmental policy is a case in point. However, the maximization hypothesis and its methodological foundation have been criticized on many grounds related to a lack of either logical or empirical content. Moreover, over the years a great many alternative models of behaviour have been proposed. Both criticism and alternatives are surveyed here. Attention is devoted to relevant insights from the philosophy of science, the notion of methodological individualism, and other criticism. The alternative behavioural models include bounded rationality and 'satisficing', lexicographic preferences, habitual behaviour, incommensurability and multicriteria evaluation, and various models of behaviour under uncertainty. Major implications of the criticism and alternative models of individual behaviour for environmental policy theory are outlined.	Jeroen C.J.M van den Bergh, Ada Ferrer-i-Carbonell, Giuseppe Munda
Redefining innovation - eco-innovation research and the contribution from ecological economics	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	While innovation processes toward sustainable development (eco-innovations) have received increasing attention during the past years, theoretical and methodological approaches to analyze these processes are poorly developed. Against this background, the term eco-innovation is introduced in this paper addressing explicitly three kinds of changes towards sustainable development: technological, social and institutional innovation. Secondly, the potential contribution of neoclassical and (co-)evolutionary approaches from environmental and innovation economics to eco-innovation research is discussed. Three peculiarities of eco-innovation are identified: the double externality problem, the regulatory push/pull effect and the increasing importance of social and institutional innovation. While the first two are widely ignored in innovation economics, the third is at the least not elaborated appropriately. The consideration of these peculiarities may help to overcome market failure by establishing a specific eco-innovation policy and to avoid a 'technology bias' through a broader understanding of innovation. Finally, perspectives for a specific contribution of ecological economics to eco-innovation research are drawn. It is argued that methodological pluralism as established in ecological economics would be very beneficial for eco-innovation research. A theoretical framework integrating elements from both neoclassical and evolutionary approaches should be pursued in order to consider the complexity of factors influencing innovation decisions as well as the specific role of regulatory instruments. And the experience gathered in ecological economics integrating ecological, social and economic aspects of sustainable development is highly useful for opening up innovation research to social and institutional changes.

Environmental attitudes, motivations, and contingent valuation of nonuse values: a case study involving endangered species	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	This paper explores relationships among environmental attitudes, nonuse values for endangered species, and underlying motivations for contingent valuation (CV) responses. The approach combines techniques from the attitude-behavior and economic valuation literature. Attitudes are measured with the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale, and economic values are derived from a referendum, CV survey for peregrine falcons and shortnose sturgeons. Respondents with stronger pro-environmental attitudes are found more likely to provide legitimate yes/no responses, while those with weaker attitudes are more likely to protest hypothetical CV scenarios. Analysis reveals environmental attitudes as a significant explanatory variable of yes/no responses, whereby stronger pro-environmental attitudes result in higher probabilities of responding 'yes'. Pro-environmental attitudes are also shown to result in higher estimates of mean willingness to pay (WTP). Significant relationships are found between environmental attitudes and nonuse motivations. Specifically, pro-environmental attitudes are associated with stronger reliance on ethical motives for species protection. These results are discussed as they relate to testing predictions in the literature about potential bias in CV studies and to supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommendations for improving CV reliability.

Environmental implications of international trade and uneven development: Toward a critique of environmental economics	Review of Radical Political Economics	2000	01	01	"Abstract: The main premises and the environmental implications of neoclassical trade theory and environmental economics are put under Marxist scrutiny. An attempt is then made to develop an alternative Marxist approach in investigating the specific significance of the capitalist mode of production and, more specifically, the environmental implications of international trade and uneven development. As argued, environmental degradation is largely the result of capitalist development and not of ""underdevelopment"" or poverty in Southern countries. It is further argued that international trade is ruled by absolute and not comparative advantage. This has important environmental implications insofar as the non-optimal effects of specialization, in terms of resource use, and the imbalancing effects of free trade tend to exacerbate the environmental problem."

The concept of scale and the human dimensions of global change: a survey	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Issues related to the scale of ecological phenomena are of fundamental importance to their study. The causes and consequences of environmental change can, of course, be measured at different levels and along multiple scales. While the natural sciences have long understood the importance of scale, research regarding scale in the social sciences has been less explicit, less precise, and more variable. The growing need for interdisciplinary work across the natural/social science divide, however, demands that each achieve some common understandings about scaling issues. This survey seeks to facilitate the dialogue between natural and social scientists by reviewing some of the more important aspects of the concept of scale employed in the social sciences, especially as they relate to the human dimensions of global environmental change. The survey presents the fundamentals of scale, examines four general scaling issues typical of social science, and explores how different social science disciplines have used scale in their research.

Natural capital and sustainability	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	This paper develops and rigorously analyses a model describing the optimal use of natural capital in a utilitarian framework. Natural capital is treated as an aggregate including exhaustibles, renewables and 'environmentals', performing several functions. It is found that it converges to a steady-state in which it is kept constant by simultaneous investments and use.	Jan van Geldrop, Cees Withagen
Sustainable development and social welfare	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Sustainable development is a normative concept which involves trade-offs among social, ecological and economic objectives, and is required to sustain the integrity of the overall system. This is usefully formalized in terms of a social welfare function which is based on an aggregate of individual preferences and, as a prerequisite of intergenerational equity and overall system integrity, on a set of sustainability constraints. A 'sustainability-based social value function' is proposed to integrate these issues, and to go beyond traditional conceptions of sustainability that are either based on a value principle of maintaining some aggregate of capital ('weak sustainability'), or stationary-state criteria of maintaining social, ecological and economic assets constant over time ('strong sustainability'). Along with individual preferences and macroeconomic objectives, the proposed welfare function integrates principles of basic human needs ('critical economic capital'), integrity of the ecosystem ('critical ecological capital') and the socio-cultural system ('critical social capital'). This implies restrictions of the social opportunity space within which sustainable development can proceed and the new value function is defined.	Werner Hediger
The usury debate, the sustainability debate, and the call for a moral economy	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	This article attempts to contribute ethical to perspectives on sustainability initiatives by comparing the relationship between economy and society in the usury debate in early modern England and the sustainability debate in the late 20th century. This comparison highlights is the changing relationship between economy and society has been a self-conscious and hotly debated struggle among various groups at various times in history. The article concludes that if sustainability is going to be a viable ethical project, it may have to reclaim access to social and political relations which have been increasingly privatized in market economy throughout the modern period.

International trade and environmental quality: a survey	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	International trade has been incorporating various aspects of environmental issues since 1970. The extent to which environmental problems might affect many facets of trade, or vice versa, has been the subject of considerable debate over these years. In this article we have attempted to establish some of the links between international trade and environmental quality by performing a comprehensive literature review. We discuss issues such as establishing direct and indirect effects of international trade on environmental quality, effects of trade on economic development, environmental quality, and energy and their relation with each other, and, finally, the role of governments and international organizations in this context. Studies have so far revealed some linkages between trade and environment through conventional trade theory. However, interactions between international trade and types of pollution, their sink and assimilative capacity need to be analyzed using a general equilibrium approach. Currently, very little knowledge and agreement on the nature of interactions between trade theories, development process and environmental quality exist. Existing studies have shown that the structure of environmental regulations should be modified to reflect the existence of trade under imperfect competition. Therefore, further research on the interaction between new trade theory and environmental regulation is needed. Also, theoretical and quantitative analysis regarding the effects of environmental regulations on competitiveness and location decision is needed. The intensity and type of environmental measures vary across issues and countries. Therefore, harmonizing environmental measures creates an inefficient atmosphere, and to assume that trade restrictions will either improve or reverse the environmental damages is a serious mistake. Given the dynamic and intricate nature of the problem, trade and environment debate continues despite vast research and poses a challenge for researchers and policy makers in the foreseeable future.

The total economic value of Amazonian deforestation, 1978-1993	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	National income accounting has been criticized because of its failure to encompass the notion of sustainability. Several studies address this problem through 'green' income accounting - i.e. by adjusting conventionally measured GDP for reduction in a given country's 'stock' of natural resources. These studies generally base value on the unit net price of the resource. Other studies go beyond net price, emphasizing a natural resource's total economic value (TEV) - that is, its non-marketable as well as its marketable values. This paper combines the green income accounting and TEV approaches and applies the new framework to Brazil in order to assess the foregone economic benefits resulting from Amazonian deforestation. The results lend support to calls for greater policy emphasis on conservation of unique and irreplaceable ecosystems.	Mariano Torras
Environmental tax reform: does it work? A survey of the empirical evidence	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Environmental tax reform is the process of shifting the tax burden from employment, income and investment, to pollution, resource depletion and waste. Can environmental tax reform produce a double dividend - help the environment without hurting the economy? This paper reviews the practical experience and available modeling studies. It concludes that when environmental tax revenues are used to reduce payroll taxes, and if wage-price inflation is prevented, significant reductions in pollution, small gains in employment, and marginal gains or losses in production are likely in the short to medium term, while investments fall back and prices increase. Results are less certain in the long term. They might be more positive if models selected welfare instead of production indicators for the second dividend, and if several important variables, such as wage rigidities and the feedback of environmental quality on production, were factored into simulations.

Pathways for environmental evaluation: a walk in the (Hanging) Gardens of Babylon	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	The paper gives a methodological overview of The VALSE Project, which was a European programme of research into valuation procedures for aiding the formulation and evaluation of sustainability policy. A notion of 'valuation from the point of view of Complexity' is built up through emphasising the permanent co-existence of multiple perspectives and, more particularly, the permanent possibility of shifts in perspective. Scientific enquiries and analyses are 'tested' - validated or invalidated - partly by reference to 'internal' norms of coherence and rigour, and partly by reference to 'external' considerations relating to the particular social and ecological context of the enquiry. Through reference to the four VALSE case studies, it is shown how the application of a chosen method of analysis structures the enquiry, while the researcher also learns about the reality through listening to what is said about the situation and about the research method itself from 'other points of view'. This demonstrates an approach to the design and implementation of environmental valuation studies that fully reconciles scientific and political dimensions of a social science process.

Measuring the total economic value of restoring ecosystem services in an impaired river basin: results from a contingent valuation survey	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Five ecosystem services that could be restored along a 45-mile section of the Platte river were described to respondents using a building block approach developed by an interdisciplinary team. These ecosystem services were dilution of wastewater, natural purification of water, erosion control, habitat for fish and wildlife, and recreation. Households were asked a dichotomous choice willingness to pay question regarding purchasing the increase in ecosystem services through a higher water bill. Results from nearly 100 in-person interviews indicate that households would pay an average of $21 per month or $252 annually for the additional ecosystem services. Generalizing this to the households living along the river yields a value of $19 million to $70 million depending on whether those refusing to be interviewed have a zero value or not. Even the lower bound benefit estimates exceed the high estimate of water leasing costs ($1.13 million) and conservation reserve program farmland easements costs ($12.3 million) necessary to produce the increase in ecosystem services.

Conservation or cultural heritage? Cattle grazing in the Victoria Alpine National Park	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	The recent decision to continue cattle grazing in the VANP has not been uniformly welcomed. There exists significant scientific evidence detailing the environmental impact of grazing. This paper examines whether an opportunity has been missed to resolve the ongoing conflict that accompanies the continuation of grazing in the VANP. The potential of economic instruments in resolving this unique land use conflict is examined. It is argued unambiguously that the compensation of graziers for a change in existing institutional alpine grazing arrangement can help to facilitate a resolution of the conflict.

Ecosystem prices: activity analysis applied to ecosystems	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	In this paper a method is developed to derive prices for natural goods from information about material and energy flows within ecosystems. The derivation is based on an analogy between ecological and economic systems: both systems are characterized by flows of material and energy. To derive ecosystem prices the mathematical structure of Koopman's economic linear production model - his activity analysis - is applied to a material flow model of ecosystems. The ecological interpretation of these prices is discussed and the uniqueness of the price system is investigated. An algorithm for price calculation is derived and demonstrated with a numerical example. Finally, it is discussed whether ecosystem prices may be suitable as surrogates for economic valuations of natural goods.	Bernd Klauer

The masculine mindset of environmental management and green marketing	Business Strategy and the Environment	2000	01	01	Environmental management systems and green marketing programmes have gained increasing popularity in western market economies. They are viewed as cost-efficient, effective and just means of tackling problems associated with the impact of economic activity on the environment. It is argued in this article, however, that these optimistic views are based on a number of ideas, images and metaphors that retain many androcentric and inadequate assumptions about self, society and nature that may be incompatible with long-term environmental protection goals.

Project analysis as input to public debate: Environmental valuation versus physical unit indicators	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Monetary valuation of environmental change is useful if one aims to rank alternative projects according to some specific social welfare function. However, if the project analysis is intended as background information to a democratic debate, the advantages of monetary valuation are less obvious. This paper analyzes aggregation of information, taking normative disagreement explicitly into account. It is demonstrated that monetary valuation is not always more informative than a physical unit measure of environmental change.	Karine Nyborg
On estimating the option value of preserving a wilderness area	Canadian Journal of Economics/Revue canadienne d'√©conomique	2000	01	01	In this paper option pricing theory is used to analyse whether or not to preserve a wilderness area. A numerical approach is demonstrated that can be applied to any generalized stochastic process. The impact of assuming that amenity value follows a logistic process, rather than geometric Brownian motion, is considered. The calculation of critical levels for amenity value necessary to justify preserving a wilderness area such as the Killarney Provincial Park in Ontario or the Headwaters Forest in California is demonstrated. The impact of changing the assumed growth and volatility of amenity value is also examined.

An empirical analysis of dematerialisation:	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	This paper presents a first empirical step in filling the gap between physical and economic models, by combining a material flow model and an applied general equilibrium (AGE) model. The goal of this paper is threefold. Firstly, a new methodology is discussed for the integration of material and economic flow models. Secondly, the new methodology is tested for its empirical applicability by simulation of material policies. Finally, the analysis leads to the identification of major steps for filling the existing gap between physical and economic models further. Fiscal material policies are imposed to reduce the use of specific materials. The material levy and the accompanying labour tax reduction shift the tax burden from labour to the use of materials. The empirical illustration shows that the physical and economic flows can be made mutually compatible, and that the combined model can be used for empirical analysis of material policies. From this analysis of material policies in an economic model it may be concluded that the combination of an AGE model and a material flow model may produce an appropriate tool for analysing environmental, sectoral and distributional effects of dematerialisation policies.

Importance of forest attributes in the willingness to pay for recreation: a contingent valuation study of Irish forests	Forest Policy and Economics	2000	01	01	Data from a large-scale (over 8000) discrete choice contingent valuation study with a follow-up are used to investigate the effects of the hedonic equation for willingness to pay for access to forest recreation in Ireland. Selected forest descriptors for recreational quality show meaningful impacts and signs through a number of probit models, representing a gradient of restrictions gradually moving from the bivariate probit with heteroskedasticity to the interval data assumptions. Significance and magnitude of parameter estimates are found to be stable across the investigated models. This result supports the hypothesis that value estimates from contingent valuation methods exhibit theoretically consistent relationships with important forest attributes.

Wilderness: options to preserve, extract, or develop	Resource and Energy Economics	2000	01	01	Option-pricing is used to evaluate the sequence and timing of wilderness preservation, resource extraction, and development. Resource extraction or development results in the permanent destruction of wilderness and the loss of an amenity dividend. Resource extraction does not preclude subsequent development. If the wilderness is directly developed (without prior extraction of resources), wilderness and resource extraction options are both killed. Starting from a state of wilderness, there are two stochastically evolving barriers, one for the price of the resource, and the other for the return on development. Wilderness is preserved provided the price of the resource never catches the price barrier and the return on development never catches the return barrier.	Jon M Conrad
Scarce or Abundant? The Economics of Natural Resource Availability	Journal of Economic Surveys	2000	01	01	Most natural resources that are used in production are non-renewable. When they become depleted they are lost for future use. Does it follow that the limited availability of natural resources will at some time in the future constrain economic growth as many environmentalists believe? While classical economists have shared the belief in limits to growth, the distinctive feature of modern neoclassical economics is its optimism about the availability of natural resources. This survey suggests that resource optimism can be summarised in four propositions. First, a rise in the price of a resource leads to a substitution of this resource with another more abundant resource and to a substitution of products that are intensive in this resource. Second, a rise in the price of a resource leads to increased recycling of the resource and to the exploration and extraction of lower quality ores. Third, man-made capital can substitute for natural resources. Fourth, technical progress increases the efficiency of resource use and makes extraction of lower quality ores economical. In a critical analysis of these four propositions it is shown that while the conjecture that natural resources will never constrain future economic growth is logically conceivable, we do not and indeed cannot know whether it will be possible in practice to overcome any resource constraint.

Incorporation of risk in regional forest resource accounts	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	To be an appropriate indicator of sustainability, a net income measure projected into the future should consider risk. Several authors have demonstrated how risk can be formally incorporated into welfare measures like Green Net National Product (NNP), however, the resulting measure can be considerably more complex than its deterministic counterpart. A practical alternative to formally incorporating risk is to use simulations of the type outlined in this paper to provide information about the expected impact of risk. This information can be used to apply a stochastic version of a sustainability rule that requires that the expected value of net income be non declining. This paper discusses the importance of risk and uncertainty to welfare measurement and more specifically the measurement of net income from forest services in a region of northern Alberta. Two different approaches to valuing resource extraction are compared. The depreciation approach and the wealth-based approach provide very different projections of net income. We demonstrate that when a renewable resource is subject to risk, the wealth-based approach provides a more appropriate measure of the influence of resource use on future consumption possibilities and the sustainability of net income.

The importance of economic costs in the development of guidelines for spatial conservation management	Biological Conservation	2000	01	01	The paper analyses the efficient spatial allocation of subsidies for biodiversity-enhancing land use. For this purpose a spatial allocation model for two different regions is developed which allows guidelines to be derived on how to achieve the highest possible ecological benefit within a given budget provided to support biodiversity-enhancing forms of land use. In contrast to other conservation biological models, our model includes more realistic economic assumptions. The difference from economic models dealing with the efficient spatial allocation of environmental goods is that the benefit function of our model is based on ecological theory. Therefore, our results differ from those obtained in monodisciplinary studies. In particular, with increasing marginal costs a more even allocation of resources becomes optimal.

Net national product, wealth, and social well-being	Environment and Development Economics	2000	01	01	This paper is about net national product (NNP). We are concerned with what NNP means, what it should include, what it offers us and, therefore, why we may be interested in it. We show that NNP, properly defined, can be used to evaluate economic policies, but we also show that it should not be used in any of its more customary roles, such as in making intertemporal and cross-country comparisons of social well-being. We develop such indices as would be appropriate for making those comparisons. In particular, we show that welfare comparisons should involve comparisons of wealth. Writings on the welfare economics of NNP have mostly addressed economies pursuing optimal policies, and are thus of limited use. Our analysis generalises this substantially by studying economies whose governments are capable of engaging only in policy reforms. We show how linear indices can be used for the evaluation of policy reform even in the presence of non-convexities in the economic environment. The analysis pertinent for optimising governments are special limiting cases of the one we develop. The literature on green NNP has widely interpreted NNP as 'constant-equivalent consumption'. We show that this interpretation is wrong. It is the Hamiltonian that equals constant-equivalent utility. Since both theory and empirics imply that the Hamiltonian is a non-linear function of consumption and leisure, the Hamiltonian should not be confused with NNP.	PARTHA DASGUPTA, KARL-G√ñRAN M√ÑLER
Contingent Valuation Versus Choice Experiments: Estimating the Benefits of Environmentally Sensitive Areas in Scotland: Comment	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2000	01	01	Following Boxall et al. (1996), Hanley et al. (1998) compare welfare measures derived from contingent valuation (CV) to those derived from choice experiment (CE). Using the same Gumbel distribution assumption of the unobserved component of indirect utility, they estimate welfare measures that they expect to be the same. However, they fail to acknowledge that the indirect utility specifications underlying the two sets of estimates differ. Hence, they do not compare like with like and the difference in welfare estimates cannot be definitely attributed to the difference in the two stated preference methods employed. This comment argues that their econometric analysis is flawed and does not support many of their concluding remarks. Further, disagreement is expressed with their alleged findings on the potential performance of CV in benefit transfer studies.	Riccardo Scarpa
The economics of climate change and the theory of discounting	Energy Policy	2000	01	01	This paper confronts the theory of discounting with climate change economics. Standard discounting would give long-term damages a very low present value. On the other hand, low discount rates would imply more sacrifices for present generations, although future generations may be richer. And using multiple rates would lead to economic inefficiencies. The paper first shows that arguments favouring a low or zero discount rate in general are weak, even from an ethical point of view. It goes on by considering different arguments in favour of discount rates decreasing over time, and by recalling the argument that non-reproducible environmental assets should be given a value growing over time. Through the example of climate change, it finally shows that the latter argument not only implies that the costs of damages associated to climate change should not be underestimated, but also reinforce the legitimacy of using decreasing discount rates.

Self-organization and sustainability: energetics of evolution and implications for ecological economics	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	In the 1920s, Alfred Lotka suggested that evolution results both in an increasing total energy flow through the biosphere and in increasing energy efficiency of biological processes. Later authors attempted to generalize Lotka's conjectures and to transform them into general evolutionary laws. These laws are derived from the laws of thermodynamics, and it is frequently argued that they also apply to the development of economic systems. In the present paper, an alternative interpretation of the Lotka principles is suggested which starts from the self-organization of dissipative structures. Self-organization concepts from ecological and evolutionary economics are integrated. On this basis, energetic regularities in evolutionary processes are interpreted as emergent properties of competitive self-organization. Given the close relationship between energy dissipation in economic processes and various environmental problems, thermodynamic effects of economic evolution are of practical policy relevance. The evolutionary perspective taken here implies that policy measures toward sustainable development will primarily have to affect the kinds of innovative behavior triggered in competitive processes.

Material flows and economic models: an analytical comparison of SFA, LCA and partial equilibrium models	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	The growing concern for environmental problems in the current economy has spurred the study of the way materials and substances flow through the economy, resulting in many different types of analysis. Since all of these have their merits and shortcomings, much of the present theoretical research seems to be focusing on combining the best aspects of each model type into an integrated model. The aim of this paper is to make a first step in bridging the gap between the various types of analysis of material flows in the economy, by discussing the main differences and similarities of three often employed model types: substance flow analysis, life cycle assessment and partial economic equilibrium analysis. Instead of submitting each model to a lengthy theoretical discussion, we apply them to a single, hypothetical example of a pollution problem. By doing so we are able to evaluate the differences and similarities of the methods and results of the model in a practical way. It appears that the results of the three models are complementary rather than contradictory. Each of them puts an emphasis on different aspects of 'the real world'. A sequential application of a number of limited models may therefore be an approach that provides more useful information than the tedious construction and application of an encompassing model that integrates these models.

Incommensurable preferences in contingent valuation: the case of Natura 2000 Network in Finland	Environmental Conservation	2000	01	01	In the literature of contingent valuation, a rights-based system of environmental ethics claiming that natural objects have absolute rights, has frequently been regarded as the main reason for incommensurability, i.e. for citizens' inability to find a common measure according to which all values could be ranked. In a study of 2400 Finns aged between 18 and 70, we tested whether a respondent's commitment to guaranteeing private property rights could be a reason for incommensurability beyond the respondent's possible commitment to absolute nature rights. It was found that incommensurability, modelled with lexicographic preferences, was attributable more often to private property rights than to nature rights. However, Finnish respondents who had lexicographic preferences for nature rights based their choice more often on an ethical judgement, whereas lexicographic preferences for property rights could rather be explained with an ambivalent preference construction. Lexicographic preferences for nature rights increased the willingness to pay for conservation, while lexicographic preferences for property rights decreased it. The result, which was predicted by the theory, supported the validity of incommensurability measurement. The study therefore indicates that several reasons for incommensurable preferences may exist and that it is possible to measure these reasons in contingent valuation surveys in order to judge the validity of the welfare measures in environmental policy decision-making.

Is There an Environmental Kuznets Curve for Sulfur?	Journal of Environmental Economics and Management	2000	01	01	Most existing estimates of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for sulfur, which use samples of mainly high-income countries, indicate a maximum emissions turning point at middle to lower high-income levels of GDP per capita. We use a larger and more globally representative sample than previous sulfur EKC studies. We find that sulfur emissions per capita are a monotonic function of income per capita when we use a global sample and an inverted-U shape function of income when we use a sample of high-income countries. A model estimated in first differences results in a monotonic EKC when estimated with both high-income and global samples. Reductions in emissions are time-related rather than income-related.

Property rights and sustainable nature tourism: adaptation and mal-adaptation in Dalarna (Sweden) and Maine (USA)	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Tourism is viewed in many industrial nations as an environmentally friendly way to revitalize distressed rural economies and communities. In the forest regions of Dalarna and interior Maine, hopes are pinned on nature-based tourism, with the presumption that natural capital is underutilized. This paper explores the potential and pitfalls of nature tourism as a basis for sustainable rural development in regions where most land is held privately but quasi-open access for recreation has been either a right (Dalarna) or a customary entitlement (Maine). The paper applies theories of common pool resources and impure public goods to show that both property regimes are mal-adapted for sustainable nature tourism. Limited exclusion combined with rivalness in land uses mis-aligns incentives facing landowners, tourists, and recreation businesses. Short-term effects include congestion, reduced economic opportunity, and depressed production of non-recreational goods. Longer-term effects include environmental degradation and weak incentives for value-added investment. Tourism development is further impeded by a scale mis-match between small ownerships and large efficient recreation management units. The analysis suggests that sustainable nature tourism faces four land use challenges.	David Vail, Lars Hultkrantz
A Review of the Economics of Biological Natural Resources	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2000	01	01	The economics of renewable biological resources originated in the 1950s in fishery economics. The original models were static and linked simple population growth models to harvesting. In the 1970s the subject became more concerned with dynamic models and the stability of resource systems and this development continued in the 1980s. Now renewable resource economics is seen as a branch of capital theory which is distinct from mainstream capital theory because it must simultaneously represent the productivity of an ecosystem as well as the production functions of the firms which exploit it. Adding to this complex patterns of ownership over the resource itself and the dependence of production on the state of the ecosystem makes for a set of problems which economists have only started to address. Progress in renewable resource economics will come through closer collaboration with ecologists to give more realistic population models; the development of approaches for multi-species ecosystems; and the use of modelling techniques and policies which can adapt as more information becomes available on the status of a resource. In the future renewable resource economics will continue to contribute to the sustainability debate by providing a clearer analysis of the trade-off between ecosystem stability and the level of economic exploitation.

Environmental Implications of International Trade and Uneven Development: Toward a Critique of Environmental Economics	Review of Radical Political Economics	2000	01	01	"The main premises and the environmental implications of neoclassical trade theory and environmental economics are put under Marxist scrutiny. An attempt is then made to develop an alternative Marxist approach in investigating the specific significance of the capitalist mode of production and, more specifically, the environmental implications of international trade and uneven development. As argued, environmental degradation is largely the result of capitalist development and not of ""underdevelopment"" or poverty in Southern countries. It is further argued that international trade is ruled by absolute and not comparative advantage. This has important environmental implications insofar as the non-optimal effects of specialization, in terms of resource use, and the imbalancing effects of free trade tend to exacerbate the environmental problem."

Macroeconomic Measures of 'Sustainability'	Journal of Economic Surveys	2000	01	01	This paper reviews the policy need for indicators of 'sustainable development', and the impetus behind recent moves to establish official indicators. The range of indicators available from current economic theory is then examined. These measures may be divided into those based on flows and those based on stocks. Flow-based measures are essentially attempts to adjust Net National Product to transform it into an indicator of sustainability. Stock-based measures revolve around the concept of the natural and man-made capital stocks. We also consider the idea of Safe Minimum Standards as a sustainability indicator. The paper concludes that no currently-available single measure of sustainability is likely to be adequate.	Nick Hanley
'Sustainability' in ecological economics, ecology and livelihoods: a review	Progress in Human Geography	2000	01	01	This article reviews the work of several sets of researchers prominent in current debates over how sustainability might be interpreted and achieved. The notion of 'sustainable development' has reached a conceptual dead-end. Geographers may offer more effective investigations and critiques of socioecological transformations by instead focusing on 'sustainability' and its application to multiple dimensions of human and nonhuman processes. Such a move within geography demands critical engagement with ongoing debates in ecological economics, the ecological sciences and social applications of sustainability. Geographers are well positioned to address crucial gaps in these fields of inquiry and to propel debates over sustainability in several fruitful directions.	Christopher S. Sneddon

A discussion of the use of the sustainability index: 'ecological footprint' for aquaculture production	Aquatic Living Resources	2000	01	01	This paper critically reviews the theoretical and practical implications of adopting the original 'ecological footprint' concept as an index of the sustainability of aquaculture production systems. It is argued that the concept may provide a reasonable visioning tool to demonstrate natural resource dependence of human activities to politicians and the public at large. However, due to its inherent weaknesses, the 'ecological footprint' fails to provide a cohesive analytical tool for management. From an ecological perspective, its two-dimensional interpretation of complex ecologically and economically interacting systems is one major weakness. From an economic perspective, the 'footprint' fails to recognise factors such as consumer preferences and property rights which have a major influence on the allocation and sustainable use of resources. The interactions among social, ecological and economic factors are discussed in an attempt to foster a broader inter-disciplinary view of criteria required for a sustainable use of aquatic resources.

A renewal theoretic approach to environmental standard setting	Applied Mathematics Letters	2000	01	01	The process of environmental regulation is usually a two step one. In the first step, a standard for environmental quality is set. Then, in the second step, a regulatory mechanism is put in place to achieve this standard. In this paper, we show how renewal theory can be used to set the quality standard optimally in a dynamic and stochastic setting.	A.A. Batabyal
Valuing the environment as input: review of applications to mangrove-fishery linkages	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	The following paper reviews recent developments in the methodology for valuing the role of wetlands in supporting economic activity. The main focus will be on mangroves serving as a breeding ground and nursery habitat in support of coastal and marine fisheries. As this particular ecological function of a mangrove system means that it is effectively an unpriced 'environmental' input into fisheries, then it is possible to value this contribution through applying the production function approach. The first half of the paper overviews the procedure for valuing the environment as an input, applied to the case of a wetland supporting a fishery. Both the 'static' Ellis-Fisher-Freeman approach and the 'dynamic' approach developed by Barbier and Strand, incorporating the intertemporal bioeconomic fishing problem, are reviewed. The second half of the paper discusses briefly two recent case studies of mangrove-fishery valuation. An application in South Thailand, which is based on the static Ellis-Fisher-Freeman model, and an application in Campeche, Mexico, which is based on the dynamic approach.	Edward B Barbier
Industrial pollution in economic development: the environmental Kuznets curve revisited	Journal of Development Economics	2000	01	01	"Using new international data, this paper tests the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for industrial water pollution. We measure the effect of income growth on three determinants of pollution: the share of industry in national output, the share of polluting sectors in industrial output, and ""end-of-pipe"" (EOP) pollution intensities (per unit of output) in the polluting sectors. We find that the industry share of national output follows a Kuznets-type trajectory, but the other two determinants do not. When combined, our results imply rejection of the EKC hypothesis for industrial water pollution: it rises rapidly through middle-income status and remains roughly constant thereafter."

SPECIAL SECTION: LAND USE OPTIONS IN DRY TROPICAL WOODLAND ECOSYSTEMS IN ZIMBABWE	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Estimates of the value of carbon sequestration services provided by a savanna ecosystem and of the value of water for the supply of a number of environmental goods and services are developed in a Zimbabwean case study using an ecological-economic model that captures the interactions between ecological and economic processes. The estimated values of carbon sequestration, in both the woodlands of the Communal Area and the State Forest, are substantial, but slightly lower than the value of converting these lands to individually held agricultural land. This, and the lack of markets in which individuals can be compensated for maintaining some land under woodland as a store for carbon, creates strong incentives for households to convert woodlands to agriculture. There is a high value for additional water availability, associated with the supply of wild foods, firewood, crop production and carbon sequestration, suggesting that efforts towards conservation in this eco-region can have high economic returns.

Aggregation Biases in Stated Preference Studies	Australian Economic Papers	2000	01	01	Stated preference studies are often used to provide estimates of non-market values for cost-benefit analysis. Applications of these techniques have been criticised because of the hypothetical nature of the surveys and the possibility of bias. Various types of bias have been cited including strategic, payment vehicle, starting point, interviewer and others. However, one type of bias that has received limited attention, but has the potential to have substantial impacts on value estimates, is that associated with aggregation. In this paper the theoretical basis for aggregation is explored, and alternative approaches for aggregation are trialed. It is demonstrated that the choices made by researchers at this stage of the value estimation process can significantly affect the estimates that are to be used in cost-benefit analyses.

Paying for Restoration	Restoration Ecology	2000	01	01	The question of how society is going to pay for restoration has received little open discussion. We review existing literature and examples to explore two questions: How should ecological and economic considerations be balanced in determining expenditures on restoration projects? and How is society going to pay for the substantial costs involved? We discuss a number of different techniques for determining the amount of money to allocate to restoration efforts, including ecosystem replacement costs, quantifying ecosystem services, contingent valuation, and surrogate market price techniques. We then review different strategies for paying for restoration including private funding by the party responsible for the damage, public funding through taxes, voluntary contributions, and various public/private partnerships. We conclude by discussing other considerations in developing strategies to pay for restoration, including uncertainty, time-scale, evaluating success, and regional planning.	Karen D. Holl, Richard B. Howarth
The discursive community: evolving institutional structures for planning sustainability	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	Attempting to develop processes for the formulation of sustainable development policy is imperative in contemporary society. Ecological economics offers the opportunity to consider the integration of economic, socio-cultural and environmental aspects of problems in sustainable development policy processes. Practical engagement in the integration of these various facets of a problem requires a release from disciplinary and institutional rigidity. To enable this release requires an enhanced understanding of our cultural referents that have historically promoted these divisions and hierarchys in knowledge claims. This paper proposes that more effective sustainable development processes can be sought by collectively considering the key ecological economic concepts of sustainability, transdisciplinary and methodological pluralism. These concepts facilitate the critique of conventional policy processes, which then give way to a reformulated sustainable development policy process, termed the 'discursive community'. Through genuine stakeholder collaboration, based on learning processes, the 'discursive community' is able to articulate strategy for sustainable development.	Tony Meppem

Influence of bid and subsample vectors on the welfare measure estimate in dichotomous choice contingent valuation: Evidence from a case-study	Journal of Environmental Management	2000	01	01	After briefly outlining recent studies on the formulation of dichotomous choice contingent valuation surveys, the authors describe the sampling design procedures followed to assess the recreational value of the 'Tablas de Daimiel' National Park, in which the truncated mean was used as the welfare measure. With the data obtained from 167 interviews, a posteriori Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to estimates bias and variance of the welfare measure estimator, varying the following parameters: (1) the number and magnitude of the bids; (2) allocation of the sample among the various bid levels; and (3) the value used to truncate the willingness-to-pay distribution. Welfare measure estimator bias was found to be negligible in all the experiments conducted - each one with 1000 samples containing 400 observations - whereas sample allocation proved to have a greater effect on the accuracy of the welfare estimator than the number or magnitude of the bids. Here, the accuracy of the truncated mean estimates obtained with designs using the Cooper method is compared, for different truncation points, with the accuracy of the estimates obtained using an empirically constructed bid vector and a subsample size vector determined as per the Duffield and Patterson approach. The latter were found to be comparable to the Cooper optimal designs.	L J√∫dez, R de Andr√©s, C P√©rez Hugalde, E Urzainqui, M Iba√±ez
Ecosystems, contingent valuation and ethics: the case of wetland re-creation	Ecological Economics	2000	01	01	This paper addresses a current issue in environmental valuation, namely, the extent to which environmental preferences depart from the usual economic paradigm to incorporate some lexicographic elements. After a theoretical discussion the paper reviews attempts to explore this question empirically by supplementing contingent valuation analyses with an exploration of the motives behind willingness-to-pay responses, including zero bids and refusals to answer. This is followed by the presentation of new evidence investigating respondents willingness to pay for the creation of a wetland taken from 713 personal interviews of the British public.	Clive L Spash
Exergy and industrial ecology-Part 1: An exergy-based definition of consumption and a thermodynamic interpretation of ecosystem evolution	Exergy : an international journal	2001	01	01	A central theme of industrial ecology (IE) is the idea of using the cyclical resource-use patterns observed in mature, biological ecosystems as a model for designing increasingly mature 'industrial ecosystems' whose productivity relies less on resource extraction and waste emission. In this two part series, we will use a thermodynamic interpretation of ecosystem evolution to strengthen this biological-industrial (B-I) ecosystem analogy. We begin by describing limitations in the current analogy and discussing resulting implications for the development and implementation of IE principles. We propose that these limitations arise largely from a poor definition of resource consumption. We then show that defining resource consumption as a process of removing exergy from a resource provides a basis for interpreting ecosystem evolution as a process of allowing consumption to occur with decreasing levels of depletion, i.e., a process of 'de-linking' consumption and depletion. We use thermodynamic principles to deduce the limitations and interrelation of several strategies for de-linking consumption and depletion. Lastly, we explore the benefits and limitations of using the proposed interpretation of ecosystem evolution as an analogy for the development of industrial systems.

The Ecological Footprint: A Metric for Corporate Sustainability	Corporate Environmental Strategy	2001	01	01	From a business perspective, one of the emerging debates is how can businesses contribute to the objectives of sustainable development. This article presents the ecological footprint accounting tool and demonstrates its usefulness in measuring and monitoring corporate sustainability. The application of the ecological footprint is based on a case study of the city of Liverpool whilst its usefulness to businesses is demonstrated with data available in the environmental reports of various companies. For companies, the ecological footprint is able to take a given environmental impact and through its methodology convert this impact into a land measurement (hectares). Once all environmental impacts are considered and measured, the ecological footprint becomes the total area of land required to support a company in terms of the resources they consume and the waste that they produce. An ecological footprint analysis can highlight how near or far a company is from being sustainable and identify those aspects that have the greatest ecological effect. The usefulness of the ecological footprint is the use of a land measurement that enables it to be readily and easily understood by all that have a vested interested in a company's environmental performance. The metaphorical resonance of the ecological footprint is seen as one of a number of powerful attributes.	John Barrett, Anthony Scott
Scope and scale insensitivities in a contingent valuation study of risk reductions	Health policy	2001	01	01	A contingent valuation study asking willingness to pay (WTP) for reducing the overall death risk as well as the risk for fatal and non-fatal injuries in road traffic accidents was performed in Sweden 1998. Different sub-samples were used to test for scale (different risk reductions) and scope (different outcomes) effects, existence of which implies that a respondent is capable of differentiating a WTP-answer accordingly. The results indicated that respondents needed some reference point for their valuation. For instance, dependent samples showed, contrary to independent ones, a significant difference between WTP of dying from any cause and in a traffic accident for the same relative but different absolute risk reduction. Regarding non-fatal traffic accidents, tests were performed comparing valuation of risk reductions for injuries with different outcomes but identical baseline risks and relative risk reductions. Similar to the case above, dependent samples differentiated their WTP and were willing to pay significantly more for a severe injury than for a slight one, which was not the case for independent samples.

The role of economics in global management of whales: re-forming or re-founding IWC?	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The global management of whale species, identified as an economic mixed good, is addressed by means of economic theory of bargaining and institution making. I will analyse (i) why it is important to take into account explicitly both (consumptive) use and non-use values within international conventions on global mixed goods; (ii) the role and nature of institutions dealing with global issues; (iii) the role of bargaining between conflicting interests as a focal feature of the institution-making process; and, (iv) the role of economic thinking in international conventions. Co-operative and non co-operative solutions are discussed, and instruments aimed at achieving co-operative bargaining, analysed. The study has both positive and normative implications, with insights on social welfare enhancing institutional reforms. Although the study is broad yet special focus is given to the International Whaling Commission (IWC). This paper concludes that we should make economic theory operational within the realm of global institutions. On the basis of the bargaining model, the conclusion is that IWC should necessarily be re-founded or at least re-formed, changing the convention from 'whaling' to a 'whale'. It is suggested that the possibility of introducing compensatory side payments into the bargaining arena in order to increase social welfare and enforceability with respect to a 'ban' scenario be investigated. Ethical implications of monetary compensations are considered in parallel with economic efficiency. The limits and potentialities of economics and economic instruments are also tested globally with respect to the whale and other environmental issues.	Massimiliano Mazzanti

Inspections, pollution prices, and environmental performance: evidence from China	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	In environmental economics, monitoring and enforcement issues have attracted relatively little research effort. Moreover, the bulk of the literature on these issues has been of a theoretical nature. Few have empirically analysed the impact of monitoring and enforcement activities on the environmental performance of polluters. Moreover, all existing studies have been performed in the context of developed countries. A purpose of the current paper is to partially fill this important gap by exploring the impact of both inspections and pollution charges on the environmental performance of polluters in China. While pollution charges represent an important pillar of the Chinese environmental regulatory system, our results indicate that inspections dominate and better explain the environmental performance of industrial polluters.

Box 1. Types of service and valuation	Trends in Ecology & Evolution	2001	01	01	The emerging interdisciplinary field of ecological economics should be a recognized research priority. Only through a combination of sound ecology and good economics can we hope to manage our exploitation of the biosphere in a manner that is both sustainable and efficient. This article is an invitation to ecologists to use economic tools and to participate in ecological economic debate. To this end, we review basic ecological economic concepts and discuss how the field has arisen, what benefits it offers, and what challenges it must overcome.	Paul R. Armsworth, Joan E. Roughgarden
Challenges for economic policy in sustainable management of marine natural resources	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The sustainable management of marine natural resources presents particular challenges to the managers of those resources. While such management has typically been based on biological considerations, it is argued that this has resulted in overexploitation and destruction of important marine assets in industries such as fishing and tourism. Consequently, it is concluded that other approaches are needed, with the use of economic concepts and management tools particularly relevant. At the same time, the human welfare outcomes of the application of various policy instruments must be carefully considered. While biological information is critical to the formulation and implementation of successful management regimes, it is concluded that the application of economic instruments will become more attractive to resource managers, with these instruments underpinned by consideration of property rights and an appropriate allocation of economic rents. A greater focus on these economic matters will take resource managers further in the direction of sustainable management of increasingly scarce marine resources. The conclusions in the paper are supported by various case studies from fisheries and tourism.	Derrin Davis, Donald F. Gartside
Globalisation and sustainability: environmental Kuznets curve and the WTO	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Economic globalisation is seen by many as a driving force for global economic growth. Yet opinion is divided about the benefits of this process, as highlighted by the WTO meeting in Seattle in late 1999. Proponents of economic globalisation view it as a positive force for environmental improvement and as a major factor increasing the likelihood of sustainable development through its likely boost to global investment. These proponents mostly appeal to analysis based on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) to support their views about environmental improvement. But EKC-analysis has significant deficiencies. Furthermore, it is impossible to be confident that the process of economic globalisation will result in sustainable development, if 'weak conditions' only are satisfied. 'Strong conditions' probably need to be satisfied to achieve sustainable development, and given current global institutional arrangements, these are likely to be violated by the economic globalisation process. Global political action seems to be needed to avert a deterioration in the global environment and to prevent unsustainability of development. This exposition demonstrates the limitations of EKC-analysis, identifies positive and negative effects of economic globalisation on pollution levels, and highlights connections between globalisation and the debate about whether strong or weak conditions are required for sustainable development. The article concludes with a short discussion of the position of WTO in relation to trade and the environment and the seemingly de facto endorsement of WTO of weak conditions for sustainable development. It suggests that WTO's relative neglect of environmental concerns is no longer politically tenable and needs to be reassessed in the light of recent developments in economic analysis. The skew of economic growth, e.g. in favour of developing countries, is shown to be extremely important from a global environmental perspective.	Clem Tisdell
Trade and the environment: from a 'Southern' perspective	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	"The relationship between free trade and the environment is one of the main issues of contention between environmental and ecological economics. Environmental economics assumes a positive relationship between free trade, economic growth and environmental policies. Environmental externalities may cause important damage. However, trade is not to be blamed for this. Instead, the fault lies with policy inadequacies at the national level. On the other hand, some ecological economists criticise the assumptions of environmental economics, especially the immobility of production factors and the positive correlation between income and environmental quality. They plead for measures to prevent deterioration of 'Northern' environmental standards in a 'race to the bottom' due to 'ecological dumping"" from the South. In this paper, we argue that neither environmental economics nor 'Northern' ecological economics take into account the structural conditions determining the international trade system. Based on some new empirical evidence on material flows, we stress the notion of environmental cost-shifting. If physical and political ecology perspectives are adopted, a 'Southern' approach to the trade-and-environment issue may arise."	Roldan Muradian, Joan Martinez-Alier

A note on the economics of biological invasions	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Despite the rising concern over the economic costs of biological invasions, no general modelling approach of these costs has been developed. The purpose of this note is to develop such a framework, and to demonstrate how conventional bioeconomic models of interspecific competition, such as the predator-prey model, are essentially special cases. A model of the economic consequences of the biological invasion must therefore be based on two principles. First, the economic impacts imposed by the invader will depend on the exact nature of the interspecific interaction, and secondly, the correct measure of these impacts should be based on a comparison of the ex post and ex ante invasion scenarios. An important consideration is determining whether the spread, or dispersal, of the invading species in turn affects the location and movement of the resident species in the pre-existing habitat, or whether the interspecific competition occurs solely in the same habitat area without diffusive movement of either species, or finally, whether both species dispersal and some form of interspecific competition might occur as a result of an invasion.

An analysis of externalities in agroforestry systems in the presence of land degradation	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Agroforestry can help prevent land degradation while allowing continuing use of land to produce crops and livestock on a sustainable basis. Despite the recognition that trees may have a high environmental value at the local level and the attention agroforestry has received as a tool for sustainable agricultural development, there is a lack of formal economic analyses on the role of agroforestry; this need is addressed in this study. A general economic analysis of an agroforestry operation on land prone to degradation and in the presence of positive forest externalities is developed. A numerical application is presented, based on a biophysical model of a watershed. The model is used to assess the value of forest externalities and the marginal cost of land degradation. The potential cost of incentives required to achieve a given target level of land productivity is estimated. The technique illustrated in this paper could be used to provide cost estimates that would serve as a basis for initial negotiations between stakeholders in a watershed wishing to establish a common-property approach to land management.

Natural versus manufactured capital: win-lose or win-win? A case study of the Finnish pulp and paper industry	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The effect of investments on environmental variables has been discussed through the win-win rhetoric, specifically in micro-level analysis. On the macro-level the win-win rhetoric has been replaced by the arguments for and against the substitutability of natural and manufactured capital. Here these two concepts belonging to different levels of analysis are linked by looking at the environmental and economic effects of chosen investment strategies in a traditionally capital-intensive industry over time. The paper shows that, rather than generalise the existence of win-win situations or the substitutability of capital, these positions are determined by purely situational factors. As a result, in the assessment of substitutability, the specific operating context of the industry needs to be taken into account. This implies also that environmental policy needs to be designed to be adaptive and responsive to those situational factors to create beneficial outcomes for the economy and for the environment.

Evolutionary Economic Theories of Sustainable Development	Growth and Change	2001	01	01	Sustainable development has become the dominant concept in the study of interactions between the economy and the biophysical environment, as well as a generally accepted goal of environmental policy. So far, economists have predominantly applied standard or neo-classical theory to environmental economic problems. In this article it will be argued that to fully understand a transformation of the economic system towards sustainability, standard environmental economics needs to be complemented by an evolutionary approach, that focuses the attention on irreversible, path-dependent change and long-run mutual selection of environmental and economic processes and systems. The article provides an overview of the main existing evolutionary contributions to environmental economics. Furthermore, a number of research directions of an evolutionary approach in environmental economics are discussed. It is suggested that such an approach should go beyond evolutionary theories of technical change, which dominate evolutionary economics so far, by including co-evolution of economy and environment, sustainable consumption, endogenous preference change, and climate change modeling.

Do focus groups and individual interviews reveal the same information for natural resource valuation?	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Focus groups and individual interviews have become accepted methods used in the initial stages of valuation research. Whether focus groups and individual interviews reveal similar valuation information has not been thoroughly studied. The research tests the hypothesis that focus groups yield the same ecosystem service information as do individual interviews. The research also explores how the focus group and individual interview data might differ. The analysis shows that focus groups and individual interviews are not substitutes. They yield different information about ecosystem services and resource uses.	Michael D. Kaplowitz, John P. Hoehn
Borrowing green: economic and environmental effects of green fiscal policy in The Netherlands	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	This paper analyzes the economic and environmental impact of a policy instrument that is related to the tax deductibility of interest returns and dividend yields from specified 'green' projects. We investigate this so-called 'Green Project Facility' (Regeling Groenprojecten) in the Netherlands during 1995-1999. We analyze the effect on tax income, economic growth, employment, as well as on the emission of a number of gases and on solid waste production. We find that the economic effects in general are positive. This policy instrument increases growth, employment, and net tax income. However, the environmental effects are quite mixed. This especially results from the fact that a lot of projects would have been undertaken anyhow. Furthermore, we find that this green fiscal policy instrument is skewed towards energy and building. It appears to neglect environmental problems with consumer households, industry, and transport.	Bert Scholtens
Enhancing transdisciplinary dialogue in curricula development	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	A crucial step towards realizing transdisciplinary understanding is to address transdisciplinary issues in university curricula, and to train students in critically analyzing and understanding disciplinary metaphors. We present an experimental exercise at Stockholm University with the aim of finding a constructive way to introduce transdisciplinary elements in disciplinary courses and thus increase student awareness of disciplinary metaphors. The exercise required a minimum of formal university decision procedures and thus circumvented the institutional barriers that tend to obstruct the establishment of full transdisciplinary programs.

The concept of joint production and ecological economics	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Joint production is suggested as one of the conceptual foundations of ecological economics. The notion of joint production springs immediately from the application of thermodynamics, and has a long history in economic analysis. Considerations of joint production give rise to philosophical concerns relating to responsibility and knowledge. The concept of joint production is easily comprehensible, and is also constitutive and supportive of a range of concepts current in ecological economic thought.

Economic growth and land-use changes: the declining amount of wilderness land in Norway	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The paper presents the evidence and analyses of macroeconomic factors explaining the reduction of wilderness land in Norway. The analysis is at the county level (18 counties) for the years 1988 and 1994, and the regressions are carried out as cross-section models as well as pooled, fixed effects models. Using a new, and probably unique, database that categorizes the total area in Norway into four zones of distance from larger technical installations, wilderness land has been defined in three ways, reflecting different qualities of the same type of natural resource; land as more than 5, 3 and 1 km from closest man-made encroachment, respectively. The explanatory variables comprise GDP per capita, GDP per capita squared, and population density. The main finding from the cross-sections analysis is that the relative amount of wilderness land (wilderness land as a fraction of the total area within each county) is negatively related to the level of economic activity, as measured by GDP per capita. Secondly, the fixed effects model reveals a negative relationship between economic growth and the reduction of wilderness land. These effects are tighter for wilderness land defined within a short distance from existing encroachments. A high level of economic activity and high economic growth per capita is therefore associated with less wilderness land and, hence, the study gives no support for any Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) relationships.

Emissions trading and transaction costs: analyzing the flaws in the discussion	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Although emissions trading lowers the costs of climate change mitigation, transaction costs (e.g. to find a trading partner) may reduce its cost-effectiveness. Some economists claim that transaction costs for Joint Implementation (JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects will be higher than for International Emissions Trading (IET) transfers, arguing that projects require advance approval whereas permit transfers can be automatically registered and checked annually. However, this article demonstrates the incompleteness of their views by both analyzing empirical data and discussing the theoretical conditions under which transaction costs decrease for JI and CDM and increase for IET.

Economic valuation of biodiversity: sense or nonsense?	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	This paper critically evaluates the notion and application of economic, monetary valuation of biological diversity, or biodiversity. For this purpose four levels of diversity are considered: genes, species, ecosystems and functions. Different perspectives on biodiversity value can be characterized through a number of factors: instrumental vs. intrinsic values, local vs. global diversity, life diversity vs. biological resources, etc. A classification of biodiversity values is offered, based on a system of logical relationships among biodiversity, ecosystems, species and human welfare. Suggestions are made about which economic valuation methods can address which type of biodiversity value. The resulting framework is the starting point for a survey and evaluation of empirical studies at each of the four levels of diversity. The contingent valuation method is by far the most used method. An important reason is that the other valuation methods are unable to identify and measure passive or nonuse values of biodiversity. At first sight, the resulting monetary value estimates seem to give unequivocal support to the belief that biodiversity has a significant, positive social value. Nevertheless, most studies lack a uniform, clear perspective on biodiversity as a distinct concept from biological resources. In fact, the empirical literature fails to apply economic valuation to the entire range of biodiversity benefits. Therefore, available economic valuation estimates should generally be regarded as providing a very incomplete perspective on, and at best lower bounds, to the unknown value of biodiversity changes.

Pathways to urban sustainability	Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning	2001	01	01	The concept of sustainable development has become very much in vogue in the past decade. We have also observed a shift in the interpretation of this concept from a global perspective to a meso perspective-that is, at a local, regional or sectoral level. This paper aims at highlighting the urban dimension of environmental issues. After a sketch of urban pollution problems and of tools for economic analysis, the notion of urban sustainability will be advocated as a meaningful analytical and policy concept. Next, the main focus of this paper will be on a typological approach to urban sustainability issues on the basis of three characteristic angles, viz. strong and weak sustainability, absolute and relative decoupling and the spatial ecological footprint. Various methodological issues will also be discussed, while the paper will conclude with some perspectives on policy issues. Copyright ¬© 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Adele Finco, Peter Nijkamp
Risk-indexed herbicide taxes to reduce ground and surface water pollution: an integrated ecological economics evaluation	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Public policy toward pesticide use in agriculture can benefit from data coming from models that integrate ecological and economic constraints into cropping decisions and pesticide use. Herein we use such a model to focus on the environmental and economic effectiveness of a specific set of tools used to promote sustainable agriculture with less pesticide runoff - incentive-based instruments created by risk-indexed herbicide input-taxes. We measure risk by health advisory levels and by an ecological economic simulation model that estimates predicted exposure levels. We explore whether this innovative solution of herbicide input-taxes does better at reducing losses to farm net returns, and surface and groundwater loadings than quantity restrictions. Using the integrated CEEPES model, our results suggest that risk-indexed input taxes by information about individual herbicide exposure levels can be a cost-effective tool to reduce predicted groundwater exposures. No single policy, however, was efficient at simultaneously improving groundwater and surface water quality. Instead we construct an efficient policy set. We find exposure-induced taxes were most efficient for small percentage reductions in overall exposure, bans were efficient for medium reductions, and flat taxes were efficient for high reductions.

Fair trade and harmonization of climate change policies in Europe	Energy Policy	2001	01	01	In March 2000, the European Commission presented a Green Paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within Europe, supporting implementation of a Community-wide scheme in which the design and regulation of all essential elements would be harmonized at the Community level. The present paper analyzes economic arguments used to justify such a coordinated scenario, showing these arguments to be based on misleading rhetoric about fair trade and harmonization. Diverse allocations of emissions allowances across Member States are justified in theory. In practice, too, no empirical evidence or model-based results demonstrate that an uncoordinated European trading scheme would adversely affect competitiveness to any significant extent or substantially increase industrial relocations.

Getting the safe minimum standard to work in the real world: a case study in moral pragmatism	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	There is growing endorsement of local stake-holder conventions to resolve unusual environmental disputes. The conventions are separate decision-making bodies designed to by-pass conventional institutions. The hazards of a stake-holder convention which is overly-detached from conventional decision-making leads to a discourse that never successfully confronts the value controversies which the stake-holder convention is charged to resolve. A case study uncovers obvious and robust strategic manipulations of stake-holder conventions that intrude on value dialogue. An appeal to the safe minimum standard rules of Ciriacy-Wantrup, updated to engage this question, successfully corrects some of the more egregious stumbling blocks to good faith dialogue in local discourse. The proposed constraints on the stake-holder convention can be quite directive, authoritative and bureaucratic, yet the constraints are necessary to preserve good faith conduct within the dialogue.

The simple analytics of the environmental Kuznets curve	Journal of Public Economics	2001	01	01	Evidence suggests that some pollutants follow an inverse-U-shaped pattern relative to countries' incomes, a relationship that has been called an 'environmental Kuznets curve'. We present a simple and straight-forward static model of the microfoundations of this relationship, in which the curve depends on increasing returns in the technological link between consumption of a desired good and abatement of its undesirable byproduct. The curve does not depend on the dynamics of growth, political institutions, or even externalities, and can be consistent with market failure or efficiency. We conclude by presenting empirical support for increasing returns to abating some common air pollutants.	James Andreoni, Arik Levinson
Tenure security, private time preference, and use of natural resources among lowland Bolivian Amerindians	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	To estimate the effect of tenure security and private time preference on the use of different types of natural resources, such as old-growth and fallow forests, fish, and game, we did a survey and a psychological experiment with 443 households in 42 villages of Yuracar√©, Moje√±o, Tsimane', and Chiquitano Indians in the Bolivian lowlands. Results of multivariate tobit regressions suggest that: (1) among the Yuracar√©, Tsimane', and Moje√±o rates of private time preference had a small economic and statistical effect on the use of natural resources and (2) tenure security, proxied by residence duration in the village and by conflict with abutters, only affected the consumption of wildlife (principally of game). Results suggest that public policies to improve property rights over natural resources among indigenous people might have greater immediate impact on the conservation of wildlife than on the conservation of forest cover.

Deforestation, distribution and development	Global Environmental Change	2001	01	01	This paper investigates the role played by distributional factors in mediating the effects of growth and development on forest depletion in tropical developing countries. A key finding of the paper is that the distributional profile of a country significantly determines whether economic development will have either a positive or a negative effect on the rate of forest loss. In countries where levels of inequality are high, development will tend to exacerbate deforestation rates while in countries where distributional profiles are more egalitarian, the negative effects of growth and development on forest cover will be ameliorated.

Benefits of water quality policies: the Chesapeake Bay	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The Chesapeake Bay is a unique and treasured natural resource. It is the largest estuary on the Atlantic coast and one of the largest estuaries in the world. The Chesapeake drains portions of six states: Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia and the District of Columbia. As testimony to its importance, the US Congress issued a directive in 1976 to the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) to examine and identify the factors that were altering the conditions of the Bay. Nutrient delivery to the Bay, which has increased dramatically over time, was identified as one of the factors and has been the primary focus of research and policy efforts related to achieving water quality improvements. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the benefits of water quality legislation in the Bay region from 1972, the year the Clean Water Act (CWA) was promulgated, to 1996. Nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorous, are the dominant criteria addressed by this case study. Benefits are assessed from a 'with-without' perspective. That is, 1996 water quality is compared with what it would have been in 1996 without the CWA and related legislation. The US EPA CBP Watershed and Water Quality Models were used to determine the distribution of nutrient loadings from point and non-point sources and characterize water quality. Modeling results indicate that conditions in the Bay are improved in some areas for some pollutants. Total phosphorus has decreased dramatically from 'without' concentrations in all major tributaries and segments of the Chesapeake Bay. The monetized annual boating, fishing, and swimming benefits of water quality improvements in the Chesapeake Bay range from $357.9 million to $1.8 billion. These benefit estimates represent use values for persons living in the District of Columbia, and portions of Maryland and Virginia. Residents of Delaware, New York, and Pennsylvania, which are also part of the Bay Watershed, are not included in this analysis. As such, this range likely underestimates the true benefits of Bay water quality improvement.	Cynthia Morgan, Nicole Owens
Institutions and the Environmental Kuznets Curve for Deforestation: A Crosscountry Analysis for Latin America, Africa and Asia	World Development	2001	01	01	The relationship between deforestation and income across 66 countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia is examined. Institutional characteristics as well as macroeconomic policies of each country are hypothesized to impact deforestation. Results show strong evidence of an environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) relationship between income and deforestation for all three continents. Institutional structure and macroeconomic policy significantly affect the tropical deforestation process. Improvements in political institutions and governance significantly reduce deforestation. The factors leading to deforestation differ across regions, however, and there is no one-size-fits-all global policy recommendation for restraining the tropical deforestation process.

The safe minimum standard of conservation and endangered species: a review	Environmental Conservation	2001	01	01	The safe minimum standard (SMS) approach is a collective choice process that prescribes protecting a minimum level of a renewable natural resource unless the social costs of doing so are somehow excessive or intolerably high. Arguments for the SMS are typically invoked in settings involving considerable uncertainty and potentially irreversible losses. However, the SMS is most commonly viewed as existing only on the periphery of thought in traditional environmental and resource economics. The specific objectives are: (1) to define the SMS approach generally and examine theoretical support, particularly for its application in endangered species decision settings; (2) to examine the relationship between an SMS approach and benefit-cost analysis (BCA); (3) to examine the relationship between an SMS approach and non-market valuation; (4) to compare an SMS approach to alternative definitions of sustainability; and (5) to review the general consistency of the SMS approach with the USA's Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended. Recent attention on this pragmatic policy approach has been something far greater than cursory, with advances and detailed discussions on theoretical considerations, philosophical underpinnings and case study applications. While the SMS emerges as a fairly coarse policy instrument, its pragmatic value is seen in complex environmental policy applications, such as endangered species protection.	Robert P. Berrens
Stability and outcomes of common property institutions in forestry: evidence from the Terai region of Nepal	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The purpose of this paper is to explore the conditions for success of local common property institutions in forestry. The analysis is based on a case study of the Terai (lowlands) region of Nepal. Common property institutions were found to be stable despite the presence of inequality, ethnic heterogeneity, and migration into the region. This is due to the fact that these institutions build upon established systems of authority in the villages, include monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and benefit from a supportive legal environment. As far as outcomes are concerned, common property serves well to protect forests locally; however, many village residents resort to exploiting forests managed under state property. The impact of common property on poverty alleviation is ambiguous.	Rabindra Nath Chakraborty
African evidence on the relation of poverty, time preference and the environment	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	It is typically argued in the economics literature that the poor operate with a higher rate of time preference than their wealthier counterparts. The poor, it is suggested, have a higher rate of time preference because they are more concerned about present survival than they are about saving for the future. Such thinking is also central to the economic growth for environmental conservation and the poverty induced environmental degradation arguments. According to these assertions, wealth allows people to consider the future and invest in environmental conservation; and poverty leaves people with no alternative but to exploit the environment so that they may feed their families today. Evidence from the food security and famine early warning fields suggests that households in many African contexts behave quite to the contrary. During periods of food shortage, poor households will often undertake extreme measures in the present, including depriving the family of needed calories, in order to preserve productive capital for the future, such as a plough, oxen or seed stock. This evidence suggests that poor African households may, in fact, have very low rates of time preference. This calls into question our general assumptions about discount rates for developing countries, for which rates of time preference are a theoretical determinant.	William G. Moseley
Evaluating contingent and actual contributions to a local public good: Tsetse control in the Yale agro-pastoral zone, Burkina Faso	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	In this case study of the Yale agro-pastoral zone in southern Burkina Faso, the sustainability of tsetse control as a local public good was shown to depend upon farmers' contributions to establish and maintain the traps and targets that attract and kill tsetse flies. Contingent valuation (CV) techniques were used to generate estimates of farmers' willingness to pay for tsetse control in money, labour, or both forms of payment. Of the 261 households that participated in the CV survey, these proportions were 23, 37 and 40%, respectively, indicating differentiation among the population and an overall preference for labour contribution. A comparison of predicted versus actual contribution of labour indicated that only 56% of households that said they would contribute actually contributed; 3% of households that said they would not contribute actually contributed. Major factors affecting contingent contributions of labour in discrete choice models were identified as well as those to account for in any successful scheme for actual labour contribution. These factors include the age of household head, offtake of cattle, involvement in secondary activities, membership in rural organizations, current expenditure on drug therapy, and cash-on-hand. The results also indicate that full cost-recovery of the investment in targets-about US$8000-could not be achieved in the short run with the proposed contribution of US$0.90-1.00 per month per household. Contingent contributions of money were interpreted as maximum donations to expect of beneficiaries as part of the total cost of providing tsetse control.	Mulumba Kamuanga, Brent M.

The economic value of a forested catchment with timber, water and carbon sequestration benefits	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	This paper examines the optimal management strategy for a forested catchment that yields timber, water and carbon sequestration benefits. The Faustmann multiple rotation model is extended to allow for the maximisation of the net present value of these timber and non-timber benefits. The model is applied to the Thomson Catchment in Central Gippsland, Victoria. Carbon sequestration benefits are modelled via total stand biomass accumulation. The cost of carbon release back into the atmosphere upon logging is estimated as a function of rotation age using an adjusted pulpwood/sawlog ratio. The allowance for both non-timber benefits is found to lengthen the optimal rotation, in a large range of cases to infinity.	John Creedy, Anke D. Wurzbacher
Why farmers continue to use pesticides despite environmental, health and sustainability costs	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Use of chemical inputs such as pesticides has increased agricultural production and productivity. However, negative externalities from such use have increased too. These externalities include damage to agricultural land, fisheries, fauna and flora. Another major externality is the unintentional destruction of beneficial predators of pests thereby increasing the virulence of many species of agricultural pests. Furthermore, increased mortality and morbidity of humans due to exposure to pesticides are recorded especially in developing countries. The costs from these externalities are large and affect farmers' returns. However, despite these high costs, farmers continue to use pesticides and in most countries in increasing quantities. In this paper, we examine this paradox and show why farmers continue to use pesticides despite the increasing costs. We also emphasize 'lock-in' aspects of pesticide use.	Clevo Wilson, Clem Tisdell
Integrating stakeholder analysis in non-market valuation of environmental assets	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	This study employs a mixed methodological approach, using questionnaire surveys of individuals and stakeholder focus groups to investigate economic values placed on a wetland surrounding Kalloni Bay on the island of Lesvos, Greece. The questionnaire survey of local people and visitors to the area included a rating exercise of four possible development scenarios, and each individual was then asked their willingness to participate in payment for their chosen scenario, and if they were willing to participate, they were then asked a willingness to pay question. Participants were also asked a series of attitudinal questions concerning the local environment and issues relevant to the area. This information was then combined with qualitative information derived from the focus groups, which elicited opinions from important local stakeholders, such as fishermen, elected representatives, constructors and hotel owners about their priorities for both conservation and development. By combining these methodologies, information and conclusions of greater relevance to policy makers can be obtained than using either methodology in isolation.	Areti Kontogianni, Mihalis S.

Pesticide taxation and multi-objective policy-making: farm modelling to evaluate profit/environment trade-offs	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Many countries in Western Europe have introduced voluntary programmes to encourage farmers to adopt environmentally more benign practices such as integrated pest management, but more policy action appears to be needed to meet the environmental quality levels now demanded. Input taxes could assist in meeting policy objectives. The issue considered here is the identification of the most appropriate specification of a tax instrument to reduce the environmental problems of agricultural pesticide usage. This paper takes a farm systems approach to evaluation. A case-study illustration is given for a specialist arable farm in the UK, combining an economic model of land use and production with a set of environmental indicators for pesticides. Linking these two components allows the identification of the potential trade-offs between achieving reductions in the environmental burden to a number of ecological dimensions and farm income. Different pesticide tax specifications vary in both the magnitude and the direction of their impacts. The results of the model indicate that either compromises will have to be made in environmental policy, or additional instruments will be required to counter-act the negative side-effects of some instruments.

Fairness in the contingent valuation of environmental public goods: attitude toward paying for environmental improvements at two levels of scope	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Respondents to contingent valuation (CV) surveys give a variety of reasons for not wanting to pay money. This variability is likely to reflect people's attitudes toward paying for the public good change, their attitudes toward paying for public goods in general, and a component that is independent of these attitudes but unique to particular beliefs about paying (e.g. 'I can't afford to pay'). Negative attitudes toward paying can contribute to an apparent insensitivity to different levels of the same public good. In a telephone survey, northern Wisconsin property owners were asked about their WTP for four environmental public goods (biodiversity, Indian spearfishing, water quality, and wolves) at two levels of scope (part and whole). For water quality and spearfishing, the part was a chain of lakes that was geographically nested within a larger region of lakes. Similarly, the biodiversity whole represented a region comprising the smaller level of the public good. The scope conditions for wolves were quantitatively nested levels of returning 300 and 800 wolves to northern Wisconsin. Respondents' beliefs about paying for each public good and level of scope were measured in order to test their generality across the different public goods and levels of scope. Negative attitudes toward paying that are general across public goods place restrictions on the use of CV for environmental public goods. However, negative attitudes that are tied to specific environmental public goods suggest that the valuation method might be difficult to implement in these cases only. Moreover, negative attitudes toward paying that are either general or specific may contribute to perfect embedding when they are expressed across different levels of scope for the same public good. Respondents' beliefs about paying for each public good were associated with an attitude toward paying for the respective good and an attitude toward paying for public goods in general at both levels of scope. The general attitude was more explanatory of beliefs about paying for wolf reintroduction and spearfishing than were the specific attitudes. The distribution of beliefs was sensitive to the type of good being valued, but less so to the scope of the public good change. Contingent valuation practitioners should seek improvements in respondents' perceptions of the fairness of the valuation process in order to facilitate citizens' involvement in decisions about environmental public goods. Avenues for future research are proposed and discussed.	Bradley S Jorgensen, Mathew A Wilson, Thomas A Heberlein

When green isn't mean: economic theory and the heuristics of the impact of environmental regulations on competitiveness and opportunity cost	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The conventional neoclassical economic wisdom argues that the opportunity costs of environmental regulations are high, with negative implications for costs and profits and, by implication, for growth and per capita gross domestic product (GDP). The minority view that environmental controls induce cost offsets that minimise such opportunity costs is marginalised by the conventional wisdom, which assumes that economic agents are x-efficient in production. A behavioral model of the firm is presented in this paper, whereby x-inefficiency in production prevails even in a world of perfect product market competition that is dominated by rational economic agents. In this model, environmental regulations affect both the level of x-efficiency and the extent of technological change and greener firms can be cost competitive and profitable. However, private economic agents cannot be expected to adopt 'Green' economic policy independent of regulations since, in this model, there need not be any economic advantage accruing to the affected firms in becoming greener.

Risk-Cost Analysis in Ground Water Contaminant Transport: The Role of Random Spatial Variability and Sorption Kinetics	Groundwater	2001	01	01	We outline a methodology for quantifying the risk (probability) to exceed environmental regulation standards for ground water quality and coupling this risk quantification with an analysis of abatement costs for attaining an acceptable risk level. The methodology accounts for the uncertainty that results from random spatial variability in the subsurface, and for sorption-desorption kinetics. Random spatial variability implies that, with a deterministic regulating framework, the risk (probability) of exceeding given water quality targets may remain high even after abatement measures have been taken. We show how this risk can be set in focus by use of a probabilistic regulating framework, which enables better risk management. Both the environmental risk and the associated abatement costs will depend on the actual combination of subsurface variability, the ground water sampling method, and sorption kinetics, through the underlying quantification of pollutant concentration statistics. Our results emphasize the importance of a relevant account of the kinetics of the sorption-desorption process, by illustrating that neglect, or equilibrium simplification of that process, may result in highly misleading risk and abatement cost estimates.

The role of domestic timber markets in tropical deforestation and forest degradation in Ecuador: Implications for conservation planning and policy	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Studies about the impact of the timber trade on tropical forests have often oversimplified process complexity and underestimated regional variability. This study shows that forest degradation and clearing in Northwest Ecuador between 1983 and 1992 was closely linked to commercial logging. A key finding is that domestic demand is critical for shaping timber extraction and, hence, forest degradation and deforestation in this region. Low timber prices for roundwood and sawnwood at the origin, which are bolstering unsustainable forest extraction, have not been affected by market liberalization. This suggests that conservation initiatives that target international trade linkages may only be partially successful, even when they do what they are intended to do. Results suggest that market-based incentives are more likely to produce the desired results if they target and support timber producers directly. These findings are also relevant for other regions where domestic markets are a significant drive for deforestation and where local markets are supplied through the activities of small-scale, labor-intensive primary producers. Also, by emphasizing areas where logging is a dominant force, meso-level studies, like this one, not only help to more accurately estimate the impact on local forests, but also identify major resource flows and the factors promoting or hindering sustainable use, and those affecting the effectiveness of policy options.

Ecological thresholds: a survey	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The existence of ecological discontinuities and thresholds has been recognised by ecological economics as a key feature to take into account in the study of environment-economy interactions. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with ecological phenomena involving non-linear dynamics. The literature about this issue reveals that there is abundant evidence of discontinuities and threshold effects as the consequence of human perturbations on ecological systems. However, due to the complexities involved, the predictive capacity of ecology is limited and large uncertainties still remain.	Roldan Muradian
Dynamics of agricultural groundwater extraction	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Agricultural shallow groundwater extraction can result in desiccation of neighbouring nature reserves and degradation of groundwater quality in the Netherlands, whereas both externalities are often not considered when agricultural groundwater extraction patterns are being determined. A model is developed to study socially optimal agricultural shallow groundwater extraction patterns. It becomes clear that the current price of groundwater is inefficient and provides fewer incentives for the adoption of modern irrigation technology than does a system that considers the cost of desiccation and groundwater contamination in the price of groundwater. The study shows that including the impact of groundwater extraction on groundwater quality into a resource management model is particularly significant if the recharge of groundwater is large compared with stock size.

Income inequality and the environment: aggregation bias in environmental Kuznets curves	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The environmental Kuznets curve assumes an inverted U-shaped relation between environmental damage and per capita income. Recently it has been argued in the literature that in addition to income levels, the inequality in the distribution of power and income is (positively) related to environmental degradation. We provide an additional argument, based on simple aggregation, for including a measure of income dispersion in empirical analyses. When the relationship between environmental damage and household income is concave (e.g. resembles an environmental Kuznets curve), then income inequality is negatively related to total environmental damage. Results from an empirical analysis of cross-national variation indicate that the aggregation effect can run counter to and outweigh the political economy effect for some environmental indicators.

Trade-off analysis for marine protected area management	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	This paper outlines an approach to natural resource management that incorporates multiple objectives for protected area management within a decision-making framework. Both regulators and other major stakeholders are directly incorporated into the approach to enhance decision-making processes. We call this approach trade-off analysis. The approach uses a framework based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) but involves stakeholders at all stages. This holistic approach is appropriate for multiple use, complex systems such as marine protected areas (MPAs), where many different users are apparently in conflict and where linkages and feedbacks between different aspects of the ecosystem and economy exist. The paper applies trade-off analysis to the case of Buccoo Reef Marine Park (BRMP) in Tobago. Stakeholder analysis is undertaken, and social, economic and ecological criteria identified. The impacts of four different development scenarios are evaluated for these criteria. Stakeholders are asked to weight different criteria and then the outcomes of different stakeholder weightings in the MCA are used to explore different management options. For BRMP, the MCA suggests consensus around development options characterised as limited tourism development for the area surrounding the park in association with the implementation of complementary environmental management. The approach has been used to enhance stakeholder involvement in decision-making and develop consensus-based approaches to management of the MPA.

Towards an Integrated Framework for Development and Environment Policy: The Dynamics of Environmental Kuznets Curves	World Development	2001	01	01	Environmental Kuznets curves (EKCs) have recently received considerable attention in development and environment policy. But little is known on how the interaction between ecological and economic factors may result in an EKC or other qualitatively different outcomes. We introduce a restricted class of vector valued differential equations for representing the evolution of socioeconomic and environmental variables which influence or are influenced by the process of economic development. Our model includes not only the complete path of each variable over time but also the highly critical interactions among multiple variables. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that among a multiplicity of possible outcomes, an inverted-U pattern can only be obtained under specific circumstances, and requires attention to the multiple factors which form the economic-environmental system, rather than a single dominant one.

Methodological, conceptual and sampling practices in surveying recreational fisheries in the Nordic countries - experiences of a valuation survey	Fisheries Management and Ecology	2001	01	01	The planning and initial phases of a joint Nordic project for the valuation of recreational fisheries is described. The economic value of recreational fisheries was taken to include non-market value as well as the traditional market value. The design of the survey was similar for each country so as to facilitate future comparison. However, initially there were difficulties in defining categories of recreational fishermen in the different countries. Other background information also had to be adapted to national circumstances. National population registers were used as the sampling frames. The effect of this on the responses from a valuation survey is discussed. Accessibility to population register data varies by country and so do possibilities for random sampling. Legal constraints were faced when implementing a centralised mailing system.	E. Roth, A. L.

The use of willingness-to-pay approaches in mammal conservation	Mammal Review	2001	01	01	With limited monetary resources available for nature conservation, policy-makers need to be able to prioritize conservation objectives. This has traditionally been done using qualitative ecological criteria. However, since declines in species and habitats are largely the result of socio-economic and political forces, human preferences and values should also be taken into account. An environmental economics technique, contingent valuation, provides one way of doing this by quantifying public willingness-to-pay towards specific conservation objectives. In this paper, the use of this approach for quantifying public preferences towards the UK Biodiversity Action Plans for four different British mammal species is considered. The species included are the Red Squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, the Brown Hare Lepus europaeus, the Otter Lutra lutra and the Water Vole Arvicola terrestris. Willingness-to-pay for conservation was increased by the inclusion of the Otter among the species, membership of an environmental organization and awareness of the general and species-specific threats facing British mammals. It was reduced by the presence of the Brown Hare among the species being considered. These findings for British mammals are compared with other willingness-to-pay studies for mammal conservation worldwide. Willingness-to-pay tends to be greater for marine mammals than terrestrial ones, and recreational users of species (tourists or hunters) are generally more willing than residents to pay towards species conservation. The choice of technique for eliciting willingness-to-pay from respondents is also shown to be highly significant. Willingness-to-pay values for British mammals derived from contingent valuation are sensitive to the species included rather than merely symbolic. This indicates that, with care, such measures can be used as a reliable means of quantifying public preferences for conservation, and therefore contributing to the decision-making process. However, irrespective of the internal consistency of contingent valuation, the validity of the approach, especially for use in nature conservation, is disputed. Willingness-to-pay is likely to reflect many interrelated factors such as ethical and moral values, knowledge and tradition, and monetary values may not be an adequate representation of these broader considerations. Willingness-to-pay approaches should therefore be used in addition to, rather than in place of, expert judgements and more deliberative approaches towards policy decision-making for conservation.

Modelling sustainable development: systems dynamic and input-ouput approaches	Environmental Modelling and Software	2001	01	01	This paper discusses alternative approaches to modelling economy-environment systems from the perspective of sustainable development. We distinguish between systems' dynamic methods and economic approaches, including input-output (I/O) models. We then discuss the structure of two models constructed for Scotland. Firstly, a hierarchical, dynamic model is used to look at long-term trends in population, resource use and pollution. Secondly, an environmentally extended I/O model is used to estimate the effects of economic policy and structural change on pollution levels and output. We conclude with some comments on the possible future developments in modelling sustainable development.	I Moffatt, N Hanley
The use of economic and participatory approaches to assess forest development: a case study in the Ettrick Valley	Forest Policy and Economics	2001	01	01	The forest floodplain restoration project in the Ettrick Valley in the Borders Region of Scotland is a nationally important project which aims to expand and create forest floodplain habitats along the Upper Ettrick. The project aims to enhance existing habitats and wildlife whilst ensuring a partnership approach is maintained with the local community. The paper evaluates the project's success in achieving these aims, using two distinct approaches. The first, an economic approach uses the contingent valuation method to estimate the total economic value of the site. Results show that the mean willingness to contribute to this project on a one-off basis, was ¬£10.39 per household. Aggregated over the Borders population, these results suggest that the project has a minimum value of approximately ¬£450000, as compared with an estimated cost of ¬£350000. The second approach uses participatory methodology - a Citizens' Jury. A Citizens' Jury consists of a small group of people, selected to represent the general public, who meet to deliberate upon a policy question. The Jury met to assess the project and to provide qualitative information on its value and importance to the local community. The Citizens' Jury approved of the project, and although they did not place a monetary value upon it, they indicated that they valued the role it played in preserving the natural ecosystem, encouraging wildlife and educating the young. However, they were concerned about visitor access and the future management of the site.	Wendy Kenyon, Ceara Nevin
Contradictions between WTO and sustainable development? The case of environmental dumping	Sustainable Development	2001	01	01	This paper discusses how the WTO agreement deals with the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to trade and environmental policies. As the use of traditional export subsidies and other protectionist trade policies are now strongly restricted in the WTO, many countries will try to find other ways to increase competitiveness. One way of doing this is to use lax environmental taxation or regulation as indirect subsidies (i.e. 'environmental dumping'). If this is done, the reduced possibilities of using traditional protectionist trade policies could harm the environment, thus reducing the overall welfare gain from trade liberalization. Environmental countervailing tariffs have been suggested as a way of reducing incentives for environmental dumping. The WTO rules are examined in order to analyse the feasibility of the uses of environmental countervailing tariffs in the current and future framework of WTO, and the incentives and welfare consequences are analysed under different market scenarios.

Assessment of Management Options in Marine Fisheries by Qualitative Modelling Techniques	Marine Pollution Bulletin	2001	01	01	An effective management of the rapidly dwindling marine fish resources is of great ecological, economic and social importance for the future. An over-development of commercial fisheries has brought about a multitude of negative environmental impacts, such as an accelerated exploitation of stocks or a decrease of marine biodiversity, and furthermore, a profound structural change in fish industry. However, the main reason for the non-prosperous rationing of marine resources is the lack of knowledge about certain processes as well as the non-availability of adequate steering instruments. This paper addresses the lack of conceptualization in the case of uncertain knowledge. It proposes a model approach which can be used for weak but improved decision support under the premise of vague knowledge. The usage of qualitative differential equations illustrates general patterns of overcapitalization of fishing fleets. The extension of traditional model approaches by integration of additional socio-economic phenomena in this context supplies deeper insights in the dynamics of a coupled economic and ecological system. The approach provides a set of characteristic system behaviours which can be fruitfully used for the development of future management tasks.	K. Eisenack, J. Kropp
Agroindustrialization, globalization, and international development: the environmental implications	Environment and Development Economics	2001	01	01	'Agroindustrialization' comprises three related sets of changes: 1 growth of commercial, off-farm agro-processing, distribution, and input provision activities; 2 institutional and organizational change in the relations between farms and firms both upstream and downstream, such as a marked increased in vertical integration and contract-based procurement; and 3 related changes in product composition, technologies, and sectoral and market structure (Reardon and Barrett, 2000). The actual and potential environmental effect of these changes have been sparsely documented to date. There does not seem to have been any attempt at a reasonably general analysis of the pathways by which such effects might occur or of the instruments governments might have at their disposal to influence these pathways. This essay is meant to fill the latter gap while the articles and policy forum that follow provide more detailed findings and perspectives on constituent issues.	Christopher B. Barrett, Edward B.

Perseverance of perverse subsidies and their impact on trade and environment	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Theoretical and empirical aspects of policy failures due to subsidies are discussed in the context of international trade. A general classification of subsidies that cause environmental externalities is presented. The economic and environmental impacts of producer subsidies on international trade are examined with partial equilibrium analysis. The magnitude and economic and environmental relevance of subsidies in various sectors is assessed on the basis of empirical indicators. Finally, suggestions are provided on how subsidy-related policy failures can be eliminated at national and international levels.	Cees van Beers, Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh
The law and economics of reclamation bonds	Resources Policy	2001	01	01	It is becoming a standard practice for governments to require mining operations to post reclamation bonds. Yet, there have been few theoretical treatments examining the rationale for bonding mechanisms, and even fewer empirical treatments of the effectiveness of bonding. This paper addresses some of these holes in the literature. It begins by examining the rationale underlying reclamation bonds, and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of bonding as a tool for enforcing reclamation requirements. The role of bonding mechanisms is to help enforce standards, not necessarily yield efficient outcomes, and these mechanisms are best viewed as a complement to - not a substitute for - liability rules. The paper also examines the effectiveness of bonding by drawing on evidence from hardrock mining on public lands in the western United States.	David Gerard
Unilateral transfer of abatement capital	Resource and Energy Economics	2001	01	01	In a model of global carbon dioxide control, Yang (Yang, Z., 1999. Should the North make unilateral technology transfers to the south? North-South cooperation and conflicts in responses to global climate change. Resource and Energy Economics 21 (1), 67-87.) advocates the unilateral transfer of abatement capital from North to South. It is argued here that such transfers should be contingent on the South's willingness to equiproportionally abate and sequester emissions according to an efficient version of Rose and Stevens' (Rose, A., Stevens, B., 1993. The efficiency and equity of marketable permits of CO2 emissions. Resource and Energy Economics 15, 117-146.) sovereignty criterion, a straightforward and popular, though not necessarily equitable, burden sharing rule for reducing greenhouse gases on a global scale. Under this program, the North would abate less and preserve a smaller quantity of forests than it would if there were equiproportional reductions in the absence of capital transfers.	Robert E. Kohn

Testing a meta-analysis model for benefit transfer in international outdoor recreation	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The economic values of outdoor recreation are estimated using a benefit transfer approach in which one applies existing consumer surplus measures to value the resources at a new site. In this article, a benefit transfer study was conducted based on meta-analysis of existing research in outdoor recreation use values of the United States from 1967 to 1998. The meta-analysis method was used to estimate a meta-regression model, resulting in a benefit transfer function that could be applied to estimate a wide range of recreation activity values in other countries. The estimated meta-model was tested using original out-of-sample studies from countries around the world for international benefit transfer purposes. The tests reveal that there is mixed evidence in using meta-analysis of existing studies in outdoor recreation in the United States to value the recreational resources in other countries that are used by tourists. In the best case, 18 correlation coefficients between meta-predicted and out-of-sample values were positive and significant at the 5% level or greater, but nine of the 18 t-tests indicated a significant difference between the two sets of values at the 10% level. However, the absolute average percentage error of the meta-predictions was 28%, which may be acceptable for many benefit transfer applications.	Ram K. Shrestha, John B. Loomis

Bound and path effects in double and triple bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation	Resource and Energy Economics	2001	01	01	Dichotomous choice contingent valuation questions are relatively inefficient in that large sample sizes are required for a given level of estimation precision. An increasingly common approach to this problem is to supplement the initial question with subsequent dichotomous choice questions in a multiple-bound design. However, a number of commentators have suggested that such designs may generate responses which are internally inconsistent in that the distribution of underlying preferences implied by answers to the initial question may not be the same as that implied by the entire sequence of replies. We consider a variety of potential causes of such inconsistencies and use data from a contingent valuation study with two follow-ups and post survey debriefing focus groups to test both the effects caused by moving from one bound to another and those caused when respondents follow either the bid-increasing path generated by a positive response at a given bid amount, or the bid-decreasing path generated by negative responses. Results indicate that both bound and path effects are significant and generate a pattern corresponding to certain of the causes of inconsistency identified in the paper. Conclusions for the future application of such designs are presented.	Ian J Bateman, Ian H Langford, Andrew P Jones, Geoffrey N Kerr

Assessing the role of US agriculture in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generating additional environmental benefits	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	This study measures the changes in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from US crop production under a scenario where farmers face higher energy prices with the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The focus is on predicting the impact on direct and indirect energy, resource use, and measuring the changes in specific GHGs. The study also assesses the potential for additional environmental benefits from the changes in agricultural resource use. The analyses rely on the results from a calibrated mathematical programming model of regional US crop production. The model accounts for input substitution when farmers are faced with external shocks. The results suggest that when energy prices increase, there is a relatively small decrease in total harvested acreage, but a more significant drop in the use of energy-intensive resources. Overall, GHG emissions from US crop production decrease by 20%, suggesting agriculture is more effective in abating GHG emissions than the other sectors of US economy. There is also a good potential for additional positive environmental externalities from the decreases in resources used in crop production.	Kazim Konyar

Rethinking Politics for a Green Economy: A Political Approach to Radical Reform	Social Policy & Administration	2001	01	01	Because the process of achieving a green economy is bound to be political, it is important how politics is understood. This essay employs a three-dimensional model of politics (functional, constitutive, performative) in developing an approach to radical reform that accentuates political potentialities-understood in terms of debate, open exchanges of differing opinions. By exploring a central tension between the formal economy (associated with administrative and policy arenas in modern society) and the informal economy (associated with the enhancement of community), the argument concludes that achieving a green economy involves a key role not simply for the rational economic individual or the cooperative community member, but also for the citizen.

Rethinking the optimal level of environmental quality: justifications for strict environmental policy	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	Traditional environmental theory suggests that the optimal level of a pollution emission occurs when the marginal damage created by the emissions is equal to the marginal cost of reducing the emissions. We argue that the benefits from reducing pollution should be much more broadly defined to include at least three other sources of benefits. First, we develop a game-theoretic model in which firms may under-invest in cost-saving 'green technologies'. Second, we demonstrate that consideration of future damages and abatement costs leads to a lower current optimal pollution level than that obtained in traditional models. Finally, we show that ecological complexity creates indirect pathways by which greater pollution increases the likelihood of generating irreversible environmental damage. This broader definition of the benefits of pollution abatement yields an optimal level of pollution that may actually be less than the level at which conventionally-measured marginal damages are equal to marginal abatement costs. Thus, environmental policy should be stricter.	Amy Farmer, James R Kahn, Judith A McDonald, Robert O'Neill
Equilibrium pollution taxes in a two industry open economy	European Economic Review	2001	01	01	This paper involves strategic implications of environmental policy in case of two international oligopolies when countries take part in an international environmental agreement and have agreed on national target levels for a global pollutant. This set-up permits an analysis of the design of optimal emission taxes across domestic producers. By differentiating taxes between industries with different abatement cost, demand, and number of domestic firms, governments are in a position to raise national net foreign rents. It is argued that a single national emission trading programme encompassing all domestic producers cannot provide the equivalent strategic policy design.	Niels Nannerup
Distributional issues in the operation of rights-based fisheries management systems	Marine Policy	2001	01	01	Rights-based management regimes are considered by economists as an important solution to the problems of excess capacity and biological over-harvesting of fisheries. In practice, adoption of such regimes, and particularly of those relying on individual quota allocations, has often met with resistance from within the fisheries concerned. A key reason for this resistance appears to be the distributional conflicts which arise in the process of implementing the regimes. An economic analysis of the nature of these conflicts in the different contexts in which they have been observed is proposed. The approach centres on the way in which distributional conflicts can influence the operation of management systems and their impacts on fisheries, from the country to the individual firm level. As an illustration, an analysis of the economic processes at firm level is developed based on the simulation of a fishery managed under individual transferable quotas.

The cost of spatial management	European Environment	2001	01	01	The spatial dimension of agri-environmental analysis has been recognized in a large number of studies, and the implications for the choice of analytical approaches and, further, environmental policies have been investigated both theoretically and empirically. Spatial management is an integrated part of Danish legislation, which, especially, is manifested in the land use policies. In this paper we analyse the opportunity costs of spatial management, as the costs of two strategies for establishing 400 ha of forest on existing agricultural land are assessed. The first 'planning' strategy involves establishment of the forest in afforestation zones designated by the local county based on the criteria of vicinity to cities and existing forest. The second strategy involves selecting afforestation areas based on a cost-minimizing approach using spatial variations in farm economic output in the study area. Results suggest that the opportunity costs of the planning strategy are 2.5 times higher than of the cost-minimizing strategy, indicating that the additional benefits of the planning strategy need to be significant in order to justify choosing this management approach.

Reformulating the foundations of consumer choice theory and environmental valuation	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	The burgeoning field of environmental valuation has raised serious doubts about the fundamental axioms of consumer choice theory, the general validity of the Walrasian system and methodological individualism. This paper examines these aspects of consumer choice theory, paying particular attention to the pioneering contributions of Georgescu-Roegen. We argue that evidence from psychology, game theory, anthropology and contingent valuation surveys reveals a more complex pattern of decision-making than that described by neoclassical utility theory. We discuss the notions of the invariance of preferences, non-satiation, the principle of complementarity, lexicographic preferences and the hierarchy of wants with reference to environmental valuation. We also discuss the notion of marginal utility of money, the validity of the Walrasian system, and methodological individualism using scaling concept in hierarchy theory. We then address the conflict between theory and reality by introducing a probabilistic binary choice scheme under uncertainty about environmental attributes. We argue that these extensions are necessary to account for consumer choices revealed in environmental valuation surveys. We conclude with the hope that a reformulation of consumer choice theory based on realistic models of human behavior can be the basis for a viable alternative to neoclassical welfare economics.

Ecological pricing and economic efficiency	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	There is a need to accurately account for the contributions of environmental assets to the overall economy. Such accounting would permit policies that allow protection of important natural resources and aid the analytic process to determine an accurate basis for a sustainable economy. The aim is to develop an accounting framework for ecology that is sufficiently consistent with the economic framework that the two can be fruitfully combined. With appropriate definitions of the flows, the two systems can be connected into a common framework. No single measure of the system productivity and efficiency can be given for the combined system, however, until the ecosystem metabolism can be converted into economic terms. This could be done with a series of economic valuation techniques. Ecological prices could then be estimated and a single measure of ecological economic output could be given. With the net combined system input and output now in common terms, a technical system efficiency measure can logically be proposed. Because human activity inevitably involves dissipation, such emissions would now have a monetary price. Because such emissions are irrecoverable, the total output of the combined system is greater than it is under the current definition, giving rise to a technical system-wide efficiency measure.

Choice Modelling Approaches: A Superior Alternative for Environmental Valuatioin?	Journal of Economic Surveys	2001	01	01	In this paper, we examine some popular 'choice modelling' approaches to environmental valuation, which can be considered as alternatives to more familiar valuation techniques based on stated preferences such as the contingent valuation method. A number of choice modelling methods are consistent with consumer theory, and its focus on an attribute-based theory of value permits a superior representation of many environmental management contexts. However, choice modelling surveys can place a severe cognitive burden upon respondents and induce satisficing rather than maximising behavioural patterns. In this framework, we seek to identify the best available choice modelling alternative and investigate its potential to 'solve' some of the major biases associated with standard contingent valuation. We then discuss its use in the light of policy appraisal needs within the EU. An application to the demand for rock climbing in Scotland is provided as an illustration.

The Economic Value of Forest Ecosystems	Ecosystem Health	2001	01	01	ABSTRACT Forest ecosystems are being degraded and lost because of rapid population change and economic incentives that make forest conversion appear more profitable than forest conservation. All ecological functions of forests are also economic functions. Many important forest functions have no markets, and hence, no apparent economic value, justifying the use of forest land for other purposes. Imputing economic values to nonmarketed benefits has the potential to change radically the way we look at all forests and to make the pendulum swing back from a presumption in favor of forest conversion to more conservation and sustainable use. This paper surveys what we know about forest economic values and draws policy conclusions from the now substantial literature that values nonmarket benefits of forests. Estimating economic values is not enough. The subsequent stage of policy is to design markets that capture the values-'market creation'-ideally for the benefit of the many vulnerable communities that rely on the forests for their well-being. These conclusions support the wider argument for using effective economic instruments to promote conservation of the remaining forests. Forest loss involves: risks to human health; accelerated climate change; increased watershed disruption, adding to eutrophication in inland and coastal waters; loss of water quality; and loss of biodiversity.

Sustainability and the intergenerational distribution of natural resource entitlements	Journal of Public Economics	2001	01	01	The paper describes an OLG economy with a single exhaustible resource that has amenity value. The steady states of this economy form a continuum, implying path-dependency. We compare three policy scenarios; first, a 'zero extraction' policy of enforced conservation that avoids environmental degradation, possibly at the expense of intertemporal efficiency. Second, a 'grandfathering' policy that endows the present generations with all resources, and that ensures efficiency but cannot prevent a persistent decline in lifetime utility from one generation to the next. Third, a 'trust fund' policy, where future generations receive claims for the natural resource. Of the three, only the trust fund ensures efficiency and protects welfare of all generations.

Estimating Amenity Benefits of Coastal Farmland	Growth and Change	2001	01	01	This paper investigates differences in non-market farmland amenity values estimated using distinct methodologies, with a focus on the potential causes and policy implications. The paper compares farmland amenity values generated by a hedonic property value model and a contingent choice model, both estimated from data collected in the Peconic Estuary System of Suffolk County, NY. The analysis demonstrates that a combination of non-market valuation methodologies can provide policy insights not otherwise available to those relying on any single approach, and illustrates types of information that may be obscured by methodologies used in isolation.

Harvesting and conserving a species when numbers are low: population viability and gambler's ruin in bioeconomic models	Ecological Economics	2001	01	01	In bioeconomic models of renewable resources, population viability is either ignored entirely or the minimum viable population (MVP) is considered a crisp threshold below which a species is driven to extinction. Neither is consistent with ecological science. The purpose in this paper is, firstly, to enhance ecological realism in economic models by incorporating insights regarding population viability from conservation biology. We consider the effects of chance on optimal management and briefly discuss key results regarding population viability as derived by biologists. Second, as a means to 'balance interests and morality', we suggest a fuzzy compromise between the economist's and the biologist's preferred stock sizes.	Erwin H. Bulte, G.Cornelis van Kooten
Does the Private Sector Help or Hurt the Environment? Evidence from Carbon Dioxide Pollution in Developing Countries	World Development	2001	01	01	How does the nature of enterprise ownership affect the environment in an economy? Conventional wisdom and theoretical conjectures are split on this important question. In this paper we estimate a reduced-form, random-effects model using data from 44 developing countries over nine years (1987-95) to study for any systematic empirical relationship between the relative level of private sector involvement in an economy and the environmental performance of the economy in terms of its emission of industrial carbon dioxide. We control for both observed and unobserved crosscountry heterogeneity along various institutional and structural dimensions such as the scope of financial market, industrial sector composition and level of foreign direct investment. The regression results indicate that the higher the degree of private sector involvement in a developing economy, the lower is its environmental degradation. In addition, its environmental degradation is likely to be further reduced in presence of a well-functioning domestic capital market and through increased participation by developed economies in its private sector development.

Remunerating nature conservation in central European forests: scope and limits of the Faustmann-Hartman approach	Forest Policy and Economics	2001	01	01	The elementary method based on Faustmann's analysis and extended by Hartman is used for the design of payment schemes inciting forest owners to manage their assets in a way more conducive to nature conservation. It is not aimed at extending the elementary theory but rather, to elicit its most important empirical implications. It is taken for granted that the conservation benefit of a forest increases linearly with time. Linearity is not only in sufficient agreement with ecological facts but also makes it easy to derive important conditions, in particular the minimal payment inducing owners never to harvest. The theory is applied to a German beech forest model (Fagus sylvatica). It is found that inciting owners to delay cutting cannot be recommended. The instrument should be used for the objective of abandoning cutting altogether which, however, demands that the conservation objective, as expressed in its present value, is granted a very high value by society. In the sequel, various aspects as to the scheme's practicability are discussed, including the need to capitalise annual payments into one single sum, the choice of a discount rate, the allowance for current costs in forestry and the likely approval of payments in the political arena. Although the discussion identifies several obstacles to the practical application of the scheme, there appears to exist no principal reason why a conservation policy based on the Faustmann-Hartman approach should not work in forestry.

A comparison of sustainability theory with UK and European airports policy and practice	Journal of Environmental Management	2001	01	01	There are three main theoretical difficulties involved in relating sustainability to aviation, and which a research agenda for sustainable aviation needs to address. The first is uncertainty regarding the critical thresholds of global environmental systems. The second is a lack of protocols for allocating permissible environmental consumption shares to, and hence targets for, individual enterprises or sectors. The third is differing value judgements of what natural features should be sustained. For the time being, these difficulties preclude determination of the degree of sustainability or unsustainability of any individual airport with respect to global environmental systems. Nevertheless, at this stage it can at least be said that since most economic activity has an adverse environmental impact, airports with higher throughputs of material and people will tend to be less sustainable than smaller-scale airports given similar technologies and regulatory compliance. This is theoretically supported and illustrated with waste arising as an indicator at reviewed airports. Despite governmental policies of sustainable mobility, there is a disjunction between EU and UK policy on airports and individual airport practice, and environmental sustainability theory. In the UK and EU, airport practice and governmental policy is to mitigate the impacts of aviation, but not at the expense of its aviation growth. This mitigation practice is summarised for the reviewed airports and presented in a framework that accounts for the suggested, interim approach to sustainability assessment.	Paul Upham

Applying a Method of Paired Comparisons to Measure Economic Values for Multiple Goods Sets	Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics	2002	01	01	A method of paired comparison is adapted for use in estimating economic measures of value. The method elicits multiple binary choices for paired items in a choice set. Probability distributions and economic values are estimated nonparametrically and parametri-cally. The method is applied in an experimental context with a choice set composed of four private goods and several sums of money. The sample's median value estimates for the goods are generally not different than the market prices for these goods. People who are in the market for a good value it higher than those not in the market for the good.	Randall S. Rosenberger, George L. Peterson, John B. Loomis

An Exploration of the Conceptual and Empirical Basis of the Environmental Kuznets Curve	Australian Economic Papers	2002	01	01	We examine the conceptual and empirical basis of the environmental Kuznets curve. From both perspectives, the relationship lacks firm foundations. In particular, the empirical relationship is shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of pollutant, sample of countries and time period. This strongly suggests that there is an omitted variables problem. We find that two important omitted variables are education and inequality. Also, we show that the observed relationship is sensitive to the measure of income/welfare used. The paper concludes with a discussion of some policy implications of our findings.

A Practical Method to InternalizeEnvironmental Impacts into Cost-Benefit Analysis	Environmental Practice	2002	01	01	Governments and managers have generally conducted inadequate cost-benefit analysis (CBA) by failing to incorporate environmental impact costs. This is not a straightforward task, owing to the intangibility, in monetary terms, of most environmental goods and services. By means of a theoretical example, we present a practical approach to correct cost-benefit analysis for environmental externalities that do not need natural resource valuations. The theoretical example is based on ventures that potentially pollute river waters. However, we think that the methodological approach presented here may be used to internalize (in monetary terms) the costs of negative external impacts on the environment, which may result from any type of venture or project.

The environmental Kuznets curve and satiation: a simple static model	Environment and Development Economics	2002	01	01	The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is a hypothesis stating that pollution rises with income at low income levels but falls at higher ones. We analyse the EKC in a representative consumer model in which pollution is generated by consumption and can be abated. We show that at low income levels no abatement is optimal and pollution increases with income. Once abatement expenditures are positive, we demonstrate that satiation in consumption is not only sufficient to find an EKC, but a tendency to satiation-or in other words the condition that environmental quality is a normal good-is even necessary if we assume a standard functional form for the pollution function. Finally, we reconsider the results of two related models of the literature: We verify that the relationship between the income elasticity of demand for environmental quality and the EKC is ambiguous.

Valuing the outputs of multifunctional agriculture	European Review of Agricultural Economics	2002	01	01	Given that agriculture produces a broad array of valuable amenities in addition to commodity outputs, 'green payments' might be a tool for maximising welfare from the agricultural enterprise. Here, I argue that getting the 'green prices' wrong would entail welfare losses and trade distortions. The valuation task requires making some fine distinctions in terms of amenity type, quality and accessibility to demanders. The environmental valuation community is able in principle to provide good estimates of willingness to pay for agriculturally produced amenities, but the valuation task requires an effort on a larger scale than has yet been attempted; and approaching the welfare optimum while minimising trade distortions requires targeting 'green prices' down to the farm level.

The dominant economics paradigm and corporate social responsibility	Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management	2002	01	01	For many centuries, industrial societies in the Western modernity have been driven by a dominant social paradigm (DSP). It is argued in this paper that this paradigm has some serious difficulties in the light of the development of the field of corporate social responsibility and in the light of its practice. Therefore, a new paradigmatic foundation is required for corporate social responsibility. The dominant social paradigm is contrasted with metaphors and principles that are derived from sources that are outside the paradigmatic basis of Western modernity, and outside the paradigm of neoclassical economics. These new metaphors and principles may be suitable for further development of the corporate social responsibility paradigm as well as for reconsideration of the economics paradigm.

The quality of life in the dynamics of economic development	Environment and Development Economics	2002	01	01	The neoclassical economic growth model and its extensions in the fields of environmental economics and endogenous growth theory typically represent welfare as a single argument function of consumption when the models are analytically solved. This simplified welfare specification is narrower than those described in the quality-of-life literature and emphasized by proponents of sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to analytically solve for the properties of a growth model based on a broader quality-of-life measure. The welfare measure includes two arguments, consumption and the stock of nature capital. This formulation enables an analysis of the consequences of the dynamic tension between conventionally defined economic growth and nature capital preservation. We find that a static model without technical progress yields diverse steady states, stability properties, and comparative statics, while a model with exogenous technical progress exhibits unusual comparative dynamics and balanced growth paths. These unusual outcomes have a number of policy-relevant implications for sustainable development.	Kerry Krutilla, Rafael Reuveny

Optimal Volume of Environmentally Damaging Trade	Scottish Journal of Political Economy	2002	01	01	It is controversial whether international trade enhances or degrades the global environment. In this model, environmental quality, as measured by biodiversity, is damaged by the consequences of trade, which include the commercialization of natural habitat, pollution and bioinvasion. However, there are also benefits of trade. When both countries internalize the external costs of production and trade, measures of environmental quality may be higher or lower as a consequence of trade, but there is always, unambiguously, less trade the more environmentally damaging it is.

The value of Scotland's ecosystem services and natural capital	European Environment	2003	01	01	Life on earth depends on the ability of the environment to provide essential services. During the 1990s, attempts were made to quantify in monetary terms the benefits that the earth's ecosystem services provide. Costanza et al. (1997a) devised a methodology to assimilate the work of over 100 valuation studies to generate estimates of the monetary value of 17 ecosystem functions for 16 habitat (or biome) types. This work estimated the annual flow of global ecosystem services to be $33 √ó 1012. In this paper we apply the same methodology to Scotland to derive a current annual ecosystem service value of approximately ¬£17 thousand million ($24 √ó 109). This is an initial estimate based on the available values. Some modifications to the model are suggested that could produce a more reliable value of Scotland's ecosystem services.

Environmental Kuznets Curve for sulfur: evidence using GMM estimation and random coefficient panel data models	Environment and Development Economics	2003	01	01	The purpose of this study is to test empirically the hypothesis of the inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental damage from sulfur emissions and economic growth as expressed by GDP. Using a large database of panel data consisting of 73 OECD and non-OECD countries for 31 years (1960-1990) we apply for the first time random coefficients and Arellano-Bond Generalized Method of Moments (A-B GMM) econometric methods. Our findings indicate that the EKC hypothesis is not rejected in the case of the A-B GMM. On the other hand there is no support for an EKC in the case of using a random coefficients model. Our turning points range from $2805-$6230/c. These results are completely different compared to the results derived using the same database and fixed and random effects models.	George E. Halkos
Necessity and Inefficiency in the Generation of Waste	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2003	01	01	The laws of thermodynamics are employed as an analytical framework within which results about society's metabolism may be rigorously deduced in energetic and material terms. We demonstrate that the occurrence of waste is an unavoidable necessity in the industrial production of desired goods. Although waste is thus an essential qualitative element of industrial production, the quantitative extent to which waste occurs may vary within certain limits according to the degree of thermodynamic (in) efficiency with which these processes are operated. We discuss the question of which proportion of the amount of waste currently generated is due to thermodynamic necessity and which proportion is due to thermodynamic inefficiency.

Pricing recreation use of national parks for more efficient nature conservation: an application to the Portuguese case	European Environment	2003	01	01	This paper considers under what theoretical conditions, based on utilitarian, individual preferences, an entrance fee can be applied to some national parks before clarifying the sustainable effects of this instrument when used for conservation. The fee is discussed in terms of efficiency and equity following on from conclusions of previous theoretical reviewing, and a travel cost empirical approach is further used to estimate one for a Portuguese national park. We conclude that entrance fees are efficient only if parks have positive recreation costs and if fee system administration costs are low. Any efficient fee must be set equal to the marginal costs of supplying the park for recreation where these costs are known and below current recreation demand, or to the marginal recreation benefit of each visitor where they are unknown and/or above the current recreation demand curve. Finally, characteristics of outdoor recreation demand require the adoption of differential entrance fee schemes given revenue and equity issues.

HABITAT-FISHERY LINKAGES AND MANGROVE LOSS IN THAILAND	Contemporary Economic Policy	2003	01	01	The article develops a dynamic model of habitat-fishery linkage in which the habitat is being converted. The basic model is applied to a case study of the impacts of mangrove deforestation on the artisanal marine demersal and shellfish fisheries in Thailand. The comparative static effects of a change in mangrove area on the long-run equilibrium level of effort and fish stocks, as well as on the resulting market harvesting supply of the fishery, are determined. By estimating parameters through pooled timE-series and cross-sectional data over the 1983-96 period for the five coastal zones along the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea, the welfare impacts of mangrove deforestation are estimated. Mangrove conversion is expected to be a function of the return to shrimp farming and the input costs to farming shrimp, plus exogenous economic factors. The resulting aggregate reduced-form level of mangrove clearing by all farmers in coastal areas is empirically estimated across the five coastal zones in Thailand over 1983-96. The policy implications of the findings are discussed with respect to Thailand and the modeling of habitat-fishery linkages.	Edward B. Barbier
Evaluating non-user willingness to pay for a large-scale conservation programme in Amazonia: a UK/Italian contingent valuation study	Environmental Conservation	2003	01	01	Contingent valuation (CV) is a popular method in economics for eliciting individuals' preferences for non-market environmental resources, but very few attempts have been made to apply it to distant environmental goods of global importance. This paper reports the results of a CV study in the UK and Italy, which evaluated non-users' willingness to pay for the implementation of a proposed programme of protected areas in Brazilian Amazonia. The main focus of the survey was the wealth of biodiversity in the region proposed for protection and the ecosystem services provided by such areas. Taking both countries together, respondents were willing to pay, on average, ¬£30 (US$ 45.60) per household per annum to fund the implementation of a protection programme covering 5% of Brazilian Amazonia and ¬£39 (US$ 59.28) per household per annum to fund a 20% programme. Aggregated across households, an annual fund to conserve 5% of Brazilian Amazonia as strictly protected areas could yield around ¬£600 million (US$ 912 million) in the UK and a similar amount in Italy. It should be noted that respondents appeared to show a high degree of uncertainty in the bid decision process for such an unfamiliar and distant good, leading to questions as to the validity and reliability of results. Nevertheless, responses were non-random and systematically related to a range of socio-economic characteristics and attitudinal variables. Thus initiatives such as international financial transfers from wealthy developed countries to support the protection of threatened areas of global significance could attract widespread support in those countries.

On Heyes' IS-LM-EE proposal to establish an environmental macroeconomics	Environment and Development Economics	2003	01	01	A decade has now passed since Daly made a plea for an environmental macroeconomics. Despite an expanding literature on 'green' national accounting and the efforts of ecological economists to measure the sustainable net benefits of a growing macroeconomy, it is only recently that Daly's plea has been adequately answered. This has been achieved with the incorporation by Heyes of an 'environmental equilibrium' or EE curve into the familiar IS-LM model. However, the IS-LM-EE model proposed by Heyes is incomplete. By extending Heyes' model to include the role of technological progress and the sustainable net benefits of economic activity, this paper shows that conclusions regarding the desirability of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies alter quite radically. Moreover, it sends out a clear message that environmental concerns should be incorporated into macroeconomic models. They should not be solely confined to microeconomics.	Philip A. Lawn

Agri-environmental Instruments for an Integrated Rural Policy: An Economic Analysis	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2003	01	01	The new Rural Development Regulation of the EU reflects the shift of attention within rural areas from agricultural production towards rural development and embraces both farmers and non-farm residents. While agricultural production is required to comply with environmental standards, rural areas also have to fulfil the growing demand for landscape, outdoor recreation and wildlife conservation. This paper develops a model of a rural area where farmers and non-farm residents live together. A central government uses a combination of two-policy instruments - direct compensation payments and public services - aimed at encouraging farmers to adopt environmentally beneficial practices and at the same time to increase the provision of countryside amenities and the sustained vitality of the rural area. The optimal mix of the policy instruments is evaluated under various governmental objectives. The analysis suggests that a combination of direct payments to farmers with the supply of local public services is a promising tool for rural policy development initiatives in the EU.

Should we measure corporate social responsibility?	Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management	2003	01	01	This paper is critical towards efforts that try and measure corporate social responsibility (CSR). A critical approach can be important for the development of the theory of the emerging field of corporate social responsibility. A critical and provocative approach can generate discussion and debate. Three main points of critique are presented toward the current efforts in the literature to measure corporate contributions to economic, social and ecological sustainability. First, the use of the concepts of eco-efficiency and eco-efficacy in measuring corporate contributions to sustainability are criticized from the viewpoint of the complementarity relation of human-manufactured capital, natural capital and social sustaining functions. Second, the use of measures that focus on an individual process or an individual company are reconsidered with an approach to industrial and firm networks. Third, the use of the monetary value is reconsidered, e.g. by suggesting an approach based on physical material and energy flows and on a new paradigmatic foundation for social responsibility. The social and ecological indicators illustrating the social and environmental impacts of economic activity and of firms can be combined with economic indicators, but not expressed in monetary terms.

Biodiversity Loss and Economic Growth: A Cross-Country Analysis	Contemporary Economic Policy	2003	01	01	This article empirically examines the relationship between biodiversity loss and economic growth in light of the current debate on the effects of economic growth on environmental quality. The basic premise is that biodiversity belongs to a special class of environmental degradation because it involves complex ecosystems, the loss of which cannot be recovered by technological advances. The main finding is that although economic growth has an expected adverse effect on biodiversity, the composition of economic output can also be significant, particularly in low-income countries. The study highlights the need to develop appropriate institutions and macroeconomic policies that allow biodiversity values to be internalized in decisionmaking processes.	John Asafu‚ÄêAdjaye
Development, trade, and the environment: how robust is the Environmental Kuznets Curve?	Environment and Development Economics	2003	01	01	This paper assesses the strength of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) which posits an inverted-U relationship between per capital income and pollution. Specifically, answers are sought to the following related questions: (1) How robust is the EKC relationship?; (2) To what extent can the EKC relationship be explained by changing trade patterns as opposed to growth-induced pollution abatement? With regard to question (1), the alleged weaknesses with the EKC are assessed and new EKCs are estimated using more appropriate econometric techniques. Turning to question (2), it is argued that the impact of trade liberalization on the environment will differ from country to country depending on whether or not they have a comparative advantage in pollution-intensive production. In turn, it is argued that this depends on a country's relative factor endowments and/or its relative environmental regulations. EKCs are therefore estimated in a manner that allows the impact of trade liberalization on pollution to depend on these country characteristics. The results indicate that the inverted-U relationship between per capita income and emissions is reasonably robust and little evidence is found to suggest that trade patterns are a significant determinant of the inverted-U shape.

Environmental Optimists, Environmental Pessimists and the Real State of the World - An article examining The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World by Bjorn Lomborg	The Economic Journal	2003	01	01	This paper provides a detailed examination of Bjorn Lomborg's controversial and highly publicised book The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World. The book examines a wide range of environmental and social issues and concludes that many of these problems are not as bad as the media and environmental organisations claim. This paper concentrates on food and hunger, deforestation, air pollution and climate change and finds that Lomborg's analysis suffers from several problems, including selective use of data, over-simplification of issues, posing the wrong questions and lack of objectivity in his quest for optimistic trends. Ironically Lomborg makes the same errors as those he criticises.	Matthew A. Cole

Environment development linkages: modelling a wetland system for ecological and economic value	Environment and Development Economics	2004	01	01	Modeling the factors determining ecological and economic value gives rise to conceptual and methodological problems. Economic valuation typically focuses on use value in the short run, whether within or outside the market. Ecologists, however, are more concerned with ecological values, which provide an underlying long-run notion of value interpreted in a more general sense. This paper investigates the nature of the link between these two aspects of value in the context of a wetland in Northern India, which is also designated as a Ramsar site and a national park. A dynamic simulation model in a 'STELLA' environment is set up to understand the linkages between underlying ecological relationships and economic value emerging from them. The simulations point towards a critical dependence of economic value (direct and indirect income derived from the park) on ecological health indices. A non-linearity is to be seen in the impact of an increase in ecological health indices on tourist traffic. This responsive or elasticity with respect to ecological health is more at higher values of the indices, indicating thereby that once efforts at conservation increase the attractiveness of the park above a certain level, the impact may be cumulative and returns in terms of income may rise more than proportionately.

The failure of eco-efficiency to guarantee sustainability: Future challenges for industrial ecology	Environmental Progress	2004	01	01	"Western industrialized societies are inherently unsustainable in their present form because they depend almost exclusively on a finite supply of nonrenewable minerals and fossil fuels. In addition, the resulting wastes cause various environmental problems ranging from widespread ecosystem disruptions to global warming. The most common response to these problems has been to promote technological improvements in eco-efficiency, which Welford defined as ""adding maximum value with minimum resource use and minimum pollution."" Although constructive, improvements in eco-efficiency alone will not guarantee sustainability of industrialized societies because the limited supplies of nonrenewable minerals cannot be extended indefinitely by recycling and substitution, and a transition to renewable and nuclear energy sources would result in significant negative environmental impacts, particularly if deployed on a large scale. In addition, according to the second law of thermodynamics, industrial production technologies have inherently unavoidable environmental impacts. Finally, any hard-won improvements in eco-efficiency will soon be negated if growth in population and consumption is allowed to continue. Consequently, long-term industrial sustainability can be achieved only through a transition to a steady-state economy where the total throughput of matter-energy is kept at a constant and sustainable level. This requires not only improvements in eco-efficiency but also a reassessment of fundamental societal values that erroneously equate material consumption and economic growth with well-being and happiness. ¬© 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2004"	Michael H.

Ecological economics and the politics of knowledge: the debate between Hayek and Neurath	Cambridge Journal of Economics	2004	01	01	Hayek's epistemic arguments against planning were aimed not just against socialism but also the tradition of ecological economics. The concern with the physical preconditions of economic activity and defence of non-monetary measures in economic choice were expressions of the same rationalist illusion about the scope of human knowledge that underpinned the socialist project. Neurath's commitment to physicalism, in natura calculation and planning typified these errors. Neurath responded to these criticisms in unpublished notes and correspondence with Hayek. These highlighted the epistemological premises his work shared with Hayek's, representing a response to Hayek from Hayek's own assumptions. This paper examines the cogency and continuing relevance of the arguments in this debate.	John O'Neill
Intergenerational cost-benefit analysis and marine ecosystem restoration	Fish and Fisheries	2004	01	01		Ussif Rashid Sumaila
Sustainability Policy and Environmental Policy	Scandinavian Journal of Economics	2004	01	01	A theoretical, representative-agent economy with a depletable resource stock, polluting emissions and productive capital is used to contrast environmental policy, which internalises externalised environmental values, with sustainability policy, which achieves some form of intergenerational equity. The obvious environmental policy comprises an emissions tax and a resource stock subsidy, each equal to the respective external cost or benefit. Sustainability policy comprises an incentive affecting the choice between consumption and investment, and can be a consumption tax, capital subsidy or investment subsidy, or a combination thereof. Environmental policy can reduce the strength of the sustainability policy needed. More specialised results are derived in a small open economy with no environmental effects on utility.	John C. V.

The economics of soil productivity: local, national and global perspectives	Land Degradation & Development	2004	01	01	Soil degradation is a mounting problem on many smallholder lands in developing countries. Economic analysis has been an important tool in addressing this problem, beginning with assessments of the financial attractiveness of investing in soil conservation works. Data compiled from 67 studies of the financial attractiveness of conservation technologies suggest that many can provide positive net returns at the farm level (64*2 per cent). While such studies have made a valuable contribution, economists have been exploring additional applications of economics to the problem, such as the development of new perspectives under the guise of ecological economics. As a result, this paper argues it is an opportune time to assess progress in the field of economic analysis of soil degradation and to consider the policy ramifications of this research. Key issues are grouped into farm-level considerations, national policy linkages and global issues. A number of policy implications emerge. Clearly, devising effective incentives at the farm or community (collective action) level must be a priority. As part of this effort, even more attention should be paid to the influence of macroeconomic and sectoral policies on soil productivity. Since soil degradation is also a problem with global ramifications, there is a clear rationale for intervention at the international level via mechanisms such as international transfers.

The environment in regional science: An eclectic review	Papers in Regional Science	2004	01	01	Abstract. The environment, broadly construed, is increasingly a salient topic in regional science research. Theoretical and empirical inquiries by regional scientists have progressively begun to address the manifold environmental ramifications of regional science questions. As such, there now exists a sizeable literature on what we may call the environment in regional science. Given this state of affairs, the purpose of this article is to survey this extensive literature. To provide sufficient focus, we do this by discussing five key issues in the extant literature on the environment in regional science. These issues are: (i) regional economic development, (ii) environmental regulation, (iii) natural resources, (iv) international affairs, and (v) geographic information systems. Our survey is both retrospective and prospective in nature. We are interested not only in what has been accomplished thus far but also in where research on the environment in regional science is headed in the future.	Amitrajeet A. Batabyal, Peter Nijkamp
Effect of Ranchland Attributes on Recreational Hunting in Florida: A Hedonic Price Analysis	Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics	2004	01	01	Recreational hunting has been an attractive enterprise for some ranchers who are interested in supplementing their income from cattle. Ranchland attributes-such as parcel size, tree cover, and proximity to urban centers-are expected to influence hunters' preferences and, thus, hunting lease payments. We estimated the effects of these attributes on hunting revenues using a hedonic model. The results reveal that trees and vegetation cover on ranchlands have a positive impact on hunting revenues, indicating opportunities for silvopasture practices. Those ranchers in Florida who maintain about 22% trees and other vegetation cover receive $16.15 per acre per year from hunting leases, but doubling the cover would generate only an additional $3.20 per acre per year.

Uniform or discriminating payments for environmental production on arable land under asymmetric information	European Review of Agricultural Economics	2004	01	01	Uniform payments are often made to farmers for providing environmental goods (e.g. wetland or semi-natural landscape) on arable land. Assuming hidden information on farmers' costs of converting land for environmental purposes, this paper investigates under what conditions a uniform policy (flat-rate payment) is better than a more sophisticated mechanism that reflects provision costs. A simplified analytical case shows indeterminate results. The ranking of net benefits under the two policies depends on the relationship between the second derivatives of the environmental value and cost functions. A numerical demonstration of arable conversion to wetland in southwestern Sweden shows that net benefits under the two policies can differ significantly.	Ing-Marie Gren
Unilateral Emission Reductions and Cross-Country Technology Spillovers	Advances in Economic Analysis & Policy	2004	01	01	With limited participation in an international climate agreement, standard economic analysis suggests that a unilateral action taken by a group of countries in order to reduce its emissions is likely to be undermined by increases in emissions from other countries (carbon leakage). While analyses of carbon leakage typically have regarded the technology in each country as given, abatement technologies are in reality endogenous, and thus technology development may be affected by environmental policies. We demonstrate that with endogenous technologies and technology diffusion between countries, it is no longer obvious that reduced emissions in some countries will increase emissions in other countries. We identify cases in which reduced emissions in some countries might reduce emissions also in other countries.	Rolf Golombek, Michael Hoel

Welfare, Growth and Environment: A Sceptical Review of the Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg	Scottish Journal of Political Economy	2004	01	01	Lomborg's best-selling attempt to demolish environmental concerns has been praised by the Economist and the Financial Times, in stark contrast to the reactions of environmental scientists. We show in detail here how Lomborg selects statistics to support his optimistic views, and systematically neglects relevant but unfavourable evidence. He also ignores much of modern environmental economics, such as the use of genuine investment that captures environmental degradation, 'double dividends' from green taxation in the presence of unemployment, and local health benefits from abatement of emissions.

Economic Value of Conservation: The Case of the Asian Elephant	South Asia Economic Journal	2004	01	01	The survival of both Asian and African elephants has become increasingly critical. However, in many respects, the survival of the Asian elephant is more precarious than that of the African elephant. Throughout its range, the populations of Asian elephants have declined in recent decades while aggravating the conflict with human interests. This article examines the historical evidence about the abundance and geographical distribution of the Asian Elephant, and then discusses the economic, social and institutional dilemmas which are associated with conservation of elephants and mitigation of human-elephant conflict in Asia. The point is then highlighted and illustrated that new thinking about economic value strengthens the social case for the conserving the remaining populations of Asian elephants.	Ranjith Bandara
The approach of ecological economics	Cambridge Journal of Economics	2005	01	01	This paper discusses the major tenets of ecological economics-including value pluralism, methodological pluralism and multi-criteria policy assessment. Ecological economics offers viable alternatives to the theoretical foundations and policy recommendations of neoclassical welfare economics. A revolution in neoclassical economics is currently taking place, and the core assumptions of welfare economics are being replaced with more realistic models of consumer and firm behaviour. This paper argues that these new theoretical and empirical findings are largely ignored in applied work and policy applications in environmental economics. As the only heterodox school of economics focusing on the human economy both as a social system and as one imbedded in the biophysical universe, and thus both holistic and scientifically based, ecological economics is poised to play a leading role in recasting the scope and method of economic science.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE: A LITERATURE SURVEY	South African Journal of Economics	2005	01	01	Literature on the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is examined, focussing on the possibility that the EKC may be explained by trade patterns. If significant, this trade effect would cast doubt on the oft-stated conclusion that economic growth automatically leads to environmental improvement. Research has been insufficient, although a number of promising approaches have been developed. Although evidence on the pollution-haven hypothesis is mixed, there is enough to suggest that the EKC development path may not be available to today's developing countries. Other problems cast doubt on whether the EKC exists in any relevant sense at all.	ANTON NAHMAN, GEOFF ANTROBUS
Carbon Sequestration in Agricultural Soils: Discounting for Uncertainty	Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie	2005	01	01	The study presents a conceptual model of an aggregator who selectively pays farmers for altering farming practices in exchange for carbon offsets that the change in practices generates. Under the assumption that the offsets are stochastic and that the aggregator maximizes the sum of the offsets from the purchase that he/she can rightfully claim with a specified level of confidence subject to a budget constraint, we investigate the optimal discounting of expected carbon offsets. We use the model to empirically estimate of the optimal discounting levels and costs for a hypothetical carbon purchasing project in the Upper Iowa River basin.	Lyubov A. Kurkalova
Benefit Transfer: A Comparison of Approaches	Growth and Change	2005	01	01	ABSTRACT Benefit transfer has become increasingly important for policy researchers as a low-cost approach for assigning benefits to environmental amenities. To gain insights on how to best perform benefit transfer, this study analyzes estimates from both the travel cost (TC) and contingent valuation (CV) methods. The analysis compared the point estimate approach with the benefit function approach for transferring economic benefits between a study site and a policy site. Data from the 1996 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation for deer hunting was used to provide both the CV willingness-to-pay and the TC consumer surplus estimates. The study found that when focusing on a nonsite-specific activity such as deer hunting, benefits transferred fairly well, with the average error being slightly less than 30 percent for CV estimates and just under 35 percent for TC estimates. In addition, the empirical results suggest that the more precise benefit function approach provide some improvement to the more general point estimate approach, with the CV methods showing moderate gains while the TC method showing only minimal gains. The study also found that the closer the distance between the policy and research sites was, the more the precision of the benefit transfer increased.	PETER A. GROOTHUIS

Impact of Agriculture on Rural Tourism: A Hedonic Pricing Approach	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2005	01	01	The increased awareness of farmers' role in the maintenance of rural landscapes may contribute to a reassessment of the place of agriculture in society. In this paper, we look at how this role, in relation to landscape, is valued by rural tourists or, in other words, whether it is a response to a societal demand, as is argued by defenders of multifunctional agriculture. The results from a hedonic pricing analysis indicate that landscape features associated with agricultural activities (such as meadows and grazing cattle) positively influence the demand for rural tourism and have a positive impact on the price tourists are willing to pay for rural accommodation. This is also illustrated by the adverse impact of perceived negative externalities from agricultural production (such as intensive maize cultivation) on this price.

How Useful Is the Genuine Savings Rate as a Sustainability Indicator for Regions within Countries? Australia and Queensland Compared	Australian Economic Review	2005	01	01	This article shows how macroeconomic indicators of sustainable development can be applied to the Queensland economy. While recognising the complex and contentious theoretical and practical issues in deriving the Genuine Savings Rate (GSR) to serve as such an indicator, we use the World Bank's methodology, which includes only mineral depletion, deforestation and carbon dioxide emissions as environmental terms, to estimate GSRs for Queensland for the period 1989 to 1999, and compare these to World Bank estimates of Australia's GSR for the same period. We find that Queensland has a higher rate of natural resource depletion and a lower GSR than the whole of Australia. We also examine how well the World Bank GSR performs as a 'headline' measure of overall sustainability, review criticisms of the GSR, and compare its implicit policy implications with those of net state savings, and of the GSR plus a suite of other indicators.

Estimating the economic value of viewing griffon vultures Gyps fulvus: a Travel Cost Model study at Gamla Nature Reserve, Israel	Oryx	2005	01	01	The proper valuation of non-market environmental commodities such as wildlife viewing has significant policy implications. We implemented the Travel Cost Method (TCM) to estimate the value of viewing threatened Eurasian griffon vulture Gyps fulvus by the public at Gamla Nature Reserve, northern Israel. We used the zonal TCM, where concentric zones were defined around the site such that the cost of travel from all points in a given zone was approximately constant. We generated a visit-distance function and used it, based on 143 questionnaires, to derive the demand function for the site from which a monetary value could be estimated. The potential annual benefit of Gamla was estimated to be NIS 5.5-6.0 million (USD 1.1-1.2 million). The annual economic value of Gamla to the visiting public is approximately five times higher than the current revenue, and 85% of the visitors to Gamla came to view vultures. This information can be used to estimate the benefits of further investment in Gamla Nature Reserve, to price this site according to demand if there are budget limits, and in particular to invest in the protection of vultures and other threatened species.

Weak Disposability in Nonparametric Production Analysis with Undesirable Outputs	American Journal of Agricultural Economics	2005	01	01	Weak disposability of outputs means that firms can abate harmful emissions by decreasing the activity level. Modeling weak disposability in nonparametric production analysis has caused some confusion. This article identifies a dilemma in these approaches: conventional formulations implicitly and unintentionally assume all firms apply uniform abatement factors. However, it is usually cost-effective to abate emissions in those firms where the marginal abatement costs are lowest. This article presents a simple formulation of weak disposability that allows for non-uniform abatement factors and preserves the linear structure of the model.	Timo Kuosmanen

Systematic Variation in Willingness to Pay for Aquatic Resource Improvements and Implications for Benefit Transfer: A Meta-Analysis	Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie	2005	01	01	Researchers are increasingly considering benefit transfer approaches that allow welfare measures to be adjusted for characteristics of the policy context. The validity and reliability of such adjustments, however, depends on the presence of systematic variation in underlying WTP. This paper describes a meta-analysis conducted to identify systematic components of WTP for aquatic resource improvements. Model results reveal systematic patterns in WTP unapparent from stated preference models considered in isolation, and suggest that observable attributes account for a substantial proportion of the variance in WTP estimates across studies. The analysis also exposes challenges faced in development, estimation, and interpretation of meta-models for benefit transfer and welfare guidance. These challenges remain salient even in cases where the statistical performance of meta-models is satisfactory.	Robert J. Johnston, Elena Y. Besedin, Richard Iovanna, Christopher J. Miller, Ryan F.

The Environmental Kuznets Curve: Exploring a Fresh Specification	Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy	2005	01	01	The objective of this paper is primarily methodological. Using a new specification, we reanalyze the data on worldwide environmental quality investigated by Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger in their well-known paper on the environmental Kuznets curve (which postulates an inverse U-shaped relationship between income level and pollution). This new specification avoids using nonlinear transformations of potentially nonstationary regressors in panel estimation, which is a major unresolved econometric problem plaguing much of the existing literature. We furthermore draw conclusions from fixed effects estimation, which had eluded Grossman and Krueger. Our estimation results indicate the presence of an EKC for only six of the fourteen pollutants, whereas Grossman and Krueger find support for all but one pollutant.	David F.

"Live Better by Consuming Less?: Is There a ""Double Dividend"" in Sustainable Consumption?"	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2005	01	01	"Industrial ecology has mainly been concerned with improving the efficiency of production systems. But addressing consumption is also vital in reducing the impact of society on its environment. The concept of sustainable consumption is a response to this. But the debates about sustainable consumption can only really be understood in the context of much wider and deeper debates about consumption and about consumer behavior itself. This article explores some of these wider debates. In particular, it draws attention to a fundamental disagreement that runs through the literature on consumption and haunts the debate on sustainable consumption: the question of whether, or to what extent, consumption can be taken as ""good for us."" Some approaches assume that increasing consumption is more or less synonymous with improved well-being: the more we consume the better off we are. Others argue, just as vehemently, that the scale of consumption in modern society is both environmentally and psychologically damaging, and that we could reduce consumption significantly without threatening the quality of our lives. This second viewpoint suggests that a kind of ""double dividend"" is inherent in sustainable consumption: the ability to live better by consuming less and reduce our impact on the environment in the process. In the final analysis, this article argues, such ""win-win"" solutions may exist but will require a concerted societal effort to realize."	Tim Jackson
USING A CHOICE MODELLING APPROACH FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE STANDARDS IN URBAN WATER	JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association	2005	01	01	ABSTRACT: A series of reforms in the water industry in Australia has created a demand from the industry and regulators for objective methodologies to evaluate incremental changes in the customer service standards. In this paper, the use of choice modeling for estimating implicit prices associated with urban water supply attributes is explored. Results from multinomial logit (MNL) and random parameters logit (RPL) models show that increases in annual water bills and the frequency of future interruptions were the most important attributes. Implicit price confidence intervals based on the best models suggest that people are willing to pay positive amounts to achieve a water supply that is less frequently interrupted. The provision of alternative water supplies during an interruption and notification of the interruption were found to be unimportant to respondents. Choice modeling proved to be a useful technique and provided the industry and regulators with additional information for standard setting.

Measuring Eco-efficiency of Production with Data Envelopment Analysis	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2005	01	01	Aggregation of environmental pressures into a single environmental damage index is a major challenge of eco-efficiency measurement. This article examines how the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method can be adapted for this purpose. DEA accounts for substitution possibilities between different natural resources and emissions and does not require subjective judgment about the weights. Although DEA does not require subjective or normative judgment, soft weight restrictions can be incorporated into the framework. The proposed approach is illustrated by an application to assessing ecoefficiency of road transportation in the three largest towns of eastern Finland.	Timo Kuosmanen, Mika Kortelainen
Economic analyses to aid nature conservation decision making	Oryx	2005	01	01	Nature conservation can often be costly and the resources available are often less than are required. Resource allocations and expenditures for nature conservation have an opportunity cost in terms of foregone projects, but are rarely subjected to as much scrutiny as other public activities. Failure to apply economic tools to nature conservation decision making can result in errors in project selection, wasted use of scarce resources, and lower levels of conservation than it is possible to achieve from the resources available. In some instances where economics has been proposed for use in nature conservation research, the methodologies applied provide information that is of limited usefulness to decision makers. Non-market valuation has limited potential to help in nature conservation decision making, is costly to complete and should be supplanted by more useful techniques that focus on the cost and the payoff from nature conservation actions. In contrast, Cost Effectiveness Analysis and Cost Utility Analysis are practical tools that can provide valuable information for conservation decision makers and improve conservation achievement.

TRADE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE: IS SOUTHERN AFRICA A POLLUTION HAVEN?	South African Journal of Economics	2005	01	01	Evidence that the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) may be explained by trade patterns casts doubt on the oft-stated conclusion that economic growth automatically leads to environmental improvement. Trends in net exports as a proportion of consumption for both USA and UK trade with SACU were examined for various dirty industries. Some evidence of pollution haven effects is found, although a similar trend for clean industries suggests that this effect is weak. However, even a general shift in manufacturing industries from North to South (as opposed to a shift in specifically dirty industries) may explain the EKC to some extent.	ANTON NAHMAN, GEOFF ANTROBUS
Is strong sustainability operational? An example from Nepal	Sustainable Development	2005	01	01	This paper explores the ways that local people in different parts of the globe are working at the local level toward sustainable development, whether knowingly or unknowingly. Community forest management at the local level in Nepal is a successful model of sustainability. It exemplifies the ideals of strong sustainability, which enhances natural, economic and social capitals concurrently. The objective of such groups is to try to avoid 'the tragedy of the commons', and to conserve forests and obtain forest products by sustainably managing local forests. In addition, people realize indirect benefits of forest protection such as further control of landslides, and improvement of local watershed and microclimate. Further, users' groups are not only taking the forest products, but also increasing the forest stock, which is an act of natural capital enhancement. In addition, local communities are not only satisfying their demand for natural resources, but are also determined to increase their socio-ecological resource potential for the future.

Biodiversity and nature-based tourism at forest reserves in Uganda	Environment and Development Economics	2005	01	01	The benefits of nature-based tourism to biodiversity conservation are often presumed but rarely quantified. The relative value placed on attributes of nature parks is unknown, as is the contribution of biodiversity to tourists' willingness to visit a particular protected area. We surveyed tourists and foreign residents in Uganda to determine how preferences for particular protected areas are formed. We evaluated tourists' demand for elevated biodiversity levels (increased numbers of bird species seen), relative to other protected areas attributes. As the number of bird species increased, tourists demonstrated increased willingness to visit a protected area, independently of all other factors. We used these results to evaluate a revenue-maximizing park management strategy, and consider how revenues from nature-based tourism compare with those from local agricultural land-uses.

Economic and Societal Changes in China and their Effects onWater Use A Scenario Analysis	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2005	01	01	China's development over the last few decades has been characterized by high rates of economic growth, large-scale migration from rural areas to the fast-growing cities accompanied by changes in lifestyles, and steady population growth. These developments have left deep marks on resource availability and quality. In this article we conduct a scenario analysis of how lifestyle changes and other major developments might affect water resources. China has the longest tradition in river and water resource management in the world. Its civilization has sought to control the effects of floods and drought for thousands of years and has utilized water flows for irrigation and navigation. In the last century, competing uses such as domestic, municipal, and industrial water consumption have also become reasons for the regulation of and large-scale abstraction of water. To investigate the major changes in economy and society and their effects on the water situation in China, a set of scenarios is developed and analyzed within a structural economics framework. A hydrological model that represents water flows in the major watersheds is linked to a regional input-output model that represents socioeconomic activities in the major economic-administrative regions of China. The regional analysis shows that the North and Northwest regions are water-scarce and that lifestyle changes and technical shifts are the most important factors driving future water consumption.

Heterogeneity and Time	American Journal of Economics and Sociology	2006	01	01	Abstract. Although heterogeneity and time are central aspects of economic activity, it was predominantly the Austrian School of economics that emphasized these two aspects. In this paper we argue that the explicit consideration of heterogeneity and time is of increasing importance due to the increasing environmental and resource problems faced by humankind today. It is shown that neo-Austrian capital theory, which revived Austrian ideas employing a formal approach in the 1970s, is not only well suited to address issues of structural change and of accompanying unemployment induced by technical progress but also can be employed for an encompassing ecological-economic analysis demanded by ecological economics. However, complexity, uncertainty, and real ignorance limit the applicability of formal economic analysis. Therefore, we conclude that economic analysis has to be supplemented by considerations of political philosophy.	Malte Faber, Ralph Winkler

National account measures and sustainability objectives: present approaches and future prospects	Sustainable Development	2006	01	01	A dominant objective within the public policies of all SE Asian countries has been the achievement of economic growth. The issue of sustainability has serious implications for this policy objective. Pursuit of economic growth is concerned solely with the present, whilst sustainability is concerned with ensuring the current generation meets its present needs without threatening future generations' ability to do likewise. National accounts, such as gross domestic product, can measure healthy economies, but they can not measure sustainability. This paper, however, sets out a conceptual approach that describes the misalignment of national accounting measures with sustainability objectives and provides empirical evidence of how this misalignment can be partially overcome. An empirical approach is developed whereby certain adjustments to national accounts, based on normative social choice theory, are introduced to indicate how a partial measure of sustainability can be determined using national accounting aggregates as a base.

Pure Altruism, Consumer Behavior and Choice Modeling	Asian Economic Journal	2006	01	01	An important assumption underlying non-market valuation is that it is not the environment but the human preference that is valued. This paper attempts to test whether individual consumer behavior is influenced by a purely altruistic motive, examining the attitude of hikers towards the hypothetical removal of the Muju ski resort from the Mount Togyu National Park in South Korea. Data were collected from samples of hikers and skiers who visited the national park. The respondents were forced to consider trade-offs between the recovery of the lost environmental assets in the Muju ski resort area, skiers' additional travel time, and willingness-to-pay amounts for the hypothetical environmental improvement. It was found that hikers did not take into account skiers' disutility represented by additional travel time.	Jungho Suh, Steve Harrison
INFORMATION, WILDLIFE VALUATION, CONSERVATION: EXPERIMENTS AND POLICY	Contemporary Economic Policy	2006	01	01	The authors use experimental surveys to investigate the association between individuals' knowledge of particular wildlife species and their stated willingness to allocate funds to conserve each. The nature of variations in these allocations between species (e.g., their dispersion) as participants' knowledge increases is examined. Factors influencing these changes are suggested. Willingness-to-pay allocations are found not to measure the economic value of species, but are shown to be policy relevant. The results indicate that poorly known species, e.g., in remote areas, may obtain relatively less conservation support than they deserve. (JEL Q51, Q57, Q58)	CLEM TISDELL, CLEVO WILSON

Analysing the Agricultural Costs and Non-market Benefits of Implementing the Water Framework Directive	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2006	01	01	Implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) represents a fundamental change in the management of water in Europe with a requirement that member states ensure 'good ecological status' for all water bodies by 2015. Agriculture is expected to bear a major share of WFD implementation costs as it is compelled to reduce the emission of diffuse water pollutants. The research outlined here comprises interdisciplinary modelling of agricultural land use, hydrology and consequent water quality effects to consider both agricultural costs and the non-market recreational use (and potentially non-use) values that implementation of the Directive may generate. A theme throughout the research is the spatial distribution of the costs and benefits of WFD implementation, which is addressed through the use of GIS techniques in the modelling of agricultural land use, the integration of land use and hydrological models, and the estimation, aggregation and transfer of the economic value of the benefits.

Environmentally sustainable cities. Critical review and operational conditions	Sustainable Development	2006	01	01	The political objective calling for environmentally sustainable development has provided the canvas for lively dialogue amongst scientists and analysts. Be that as it may, what have been found wanting are operational conditions for the achievement of environmental sustainability within specific anthropogenic systems, with cities being cited as a prime example of such systems. Indeed, from a historical perspective, cities have always been based on the concentration of humans and man-made elements, resulting in respective confinement of natural assets. As cities possess particular properties for their environmental basis, the general conditions governing sustainability require suitable modifications when applied to cities. In this context, the present paper examines the conditions for environmentally sustainable development in urban systems. The specific natural and socioeconomic characteristics of urban systems are systematically taken into account for defining environmentally sustainable development in cities. The paper proposes an operational framework for evaluating urban systems for their environmental performance. Urban systems, presenting specific characteristics necessary for creating welfare with high density, ask for particular conditions for their environmentally sustainable development. These conditions differ substantially from those defining sustainability in broader geographical systems. Copyright ¬© 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.	Kostas P. Bithas, M.

Household Income and Pollution	The Journal of Environment & Development	2006	01	01	Country-level analyses of global Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) relationships that use multicountry panel data sets are likely to suffer from several types of aggregation bias that may explain why previous studies have yielded conflicting results. The authors analyze 1990 cross-sectional data for the United States for three pollutants and test the general EKC relationship as well as the pure income effect. Their results suggest that the income level at which households reduce their exposure to pollution depends on the nature of the pollutant. They find consistent evidence for such a relationship for coarse particulate matter but little evidence for nonmonotonic relationships for carbon monoxide and ground-level ozone.

Total Factor Productivity	Organization & Environment	2006	01	01	"Total factor productivity (TFP) is a central concept in the mainstream analysis of economic growth. Using aggregate production functions, economists estimate the shares of economic growth explained by increases in capital, labor, and (in some applications) natural resource inputs. The residual of unexplained growth is then ascribed to ""disembodied"" technological advance or TFP. This article develops a radical ecological-economic critique of TFP analysis. The critique uses Marxist theory to synthesize relevant nonmainstream perspectives including ecological economics (especially Georgescu-Roegen's critique of the aggregate production function and Daly's rejection of the mainstream ""circular flow"" vision of the economy), neo-Schumpetarian criticisms of disembodied technological change, and the ""identification"" critique which shows that TFP estimates merely capture the accounting identity between income and value added. From a Marxist perspective, TFP theory's false dematerialization of production technology reflects capitalism's alienation of workers and communities from necessary conditions of production."

The Economic Payoffs from Marine Reserves: Resource Rents in a Stochastic Environment	Economic Record	2006	01	01	In this paper we analysed the economic payoffs from marine reserves using a stochastic optimal control model, with a jump-diffusion process. The results show that even if the reserve and harvested populations face the same negative shocks, harvesting is optimal, the population is persistent and there is no uncertainty over current stock size, a reserve can increase resource rents. Using fishery data we demonstrate that the payoffs from a reserve, and also optimum reserve size, increase the larger is the magnitude of the negative shock, the greater its frequency and the larger its relative impact on the harvested population.

The variability of environmental protection expenditures between sectors in Sweden	European Environment	2006	01	01	The focus of this paper is on environmental protection investments for reducing emissions to air in the pulp and paper industry and in the energy and heating industry. We use data on environmental protection investments to assess the costs for environmental protection in order to characterize the potential differences between these two industries in their ability to adapt to national policymaking. We find that the energy and heating industry invests more than the pulp and paper industry in relation to their revenues. This pattern is also true if we look at the type of environmental protection investment (i.e. clean technology or end-of-pipe solutions). That the pulp and paper industry is less investment intensive with regards to environmental protection is in line with what can be expected, i.e. firms in a competitive market do not seem to have the same possibility of internalizing the external cost of production in response to 'green' consumer demand.

Evaluating the performance of different willingness to pay question formats for valuing environmental restoration in rural China	Environment and Development Economics	2006	01	01	This paper compares protest rates and willingness to pay (WTP) using a payment card versus single and double bounded voter referendum contingent valuation question formats. Using a chi-square test, the payment card had a significantly higher protest rate (6.7 per cent) than the voter referendum question format (2.2 per cent). The median WTP of the single bounded and double bounded referendum format exceeds the payment card by a factor of nine and seven, respectively. The median WTP from the referendum formats represent about 8 per cent of income, while the payment card results represents about 1 per cent of income. These large differences in WTP between question formats are double what have been found in past studies. We believe this result may be due to excessive yea saying at high bid amounts in the dichotomous choice question formats. This behavior may arise in our case study in rural China because citizens have not had a long history of open elections or voting on tax referenda.

Pollution thresholds under uncertainty	Environment and Development Economics	2006	01	01	This study investigates the optimal use of 'dirty' technologies for economic development and when to stop polluting (either temporarily or forever). This question is addressed within a real option framework where three different kinds of options arise: for stopping pollution temporarily or forever and for re-starting. The possibility to shelve a polluting technology temporarily allows for a more conservationist policy. Costs associated with the option of a re-start lead to hystereses effects that complicate empirical cross-country comparisons of environmental policies.	FRANZ WIRL
Valuation of biodiversity effects from reduced pesticide use	Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management	2006	01	01	This study deals with the effects on biodiversity of pesticide-free buffer zones along field margins. Using choice modeling, the majority of respondents to a survey on pesticide use in the environment are willing to accept an increase in the price of bread if the survival of partridge chicks and the number of wild plants increase. The study identifies the need for further empirical work with respect to methodological validation, price estimation, and the use of survey results in policy analysis. In particular, the environmental effects of pesticide use are complex and, therefore, present difficult challenges when presenting information to lay people. Forty-one percent of respondents changed their responses regarding willingness to pay more for bread when references to pesticide use were introduced in the questionnaire. This indicates that scenarios depicting changes in pesticide use can be difficult to present to lay people in an economically rational and well-defined context. Thus, in the study of valuation related to changes in pesticide use, much attention should be devoted to the design and definition of the context. Furthermore, the effects of providing different background information, e.g., with or without the mention of pesticides, should be tested.	Jesper S. Schou, Berit Hasler, Birgit Nahrstedt
ECONOMIC VALUATION OF RIPARIAN BUFFER AND OPEN SPACE IN A SUBURBAN WATERSHED1	JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association	2006	01	01	Abstract: This study evaluates the economic value of riparian buffers and open space in a suburban watershed through two nonmarket valuation methods. A contingent valuation survey was implemented in the Dardenne Creek watershed, a suburban watershed of the St. Louis metropolitan area in Missouri, to evaluate the residents' perceptions of and willingness to pay (WTP) for adopting riparian buffers and preserving farmland in a hypothetical real estate market. A hedonic pricing model based on actual sale prices of homes in the watershed was applied to estimate the market value of open space and other environmental conditions such as flood zone and stream proximity in the study area. The results showed that residents' WTP was consistent with the economic values of open space and proximity to streams embedded in existing home prices.

Second-Best Climate Agreements and Technology Policy	Advances in Economic Analysis & Policy	2006	01	01	We study second-best climate agreements in the presence of technology spillovers within and across countries, where the technology externalities within each country are corrected through a domestic subsidy of R&D investments. We compare the properties of two types of international climate agreements when the inter-country externalities from R&D are not regulated through the climate agreement. With an international agreement on emission quotas, the equilibrium R&D subsidy is lower than the socially optimal subsidy. The equilibrium subsidy is even lower if the climate agreement instead dictates that a common carbon tax should be imposed in all countries. Under a quota agreement, total quotas should be set low enough for the price of carbon to exceed the Pigovian level, whereas the opposite may be true under a tax agreement. We also show that social costs are higher under a second-best tax agreement than under a second-best quota agreement.	Rolf Golombek, Michael Hoel
Environmental Emissions and Production Economics: Implications of the Materials Balance	American Journal of Agricultural Economics	2007	01	01	In modeling emissions, the literature has usually specified an explicit emission function, or treated emissions as a production input. We examine the validity of these approaches, taking into account the materials balance principle. We show that a technology can equivalently be described by (i) a production function with material and nonmaterial inputs and bounded marginal product of the material input, (ii) a well-behaved production function with emissions as an input, and (iii) a well-behaved emission function, if the materials balance is accounted for as an additional condition. We offer a forma derivation of common, but not rigorously established modeling approaches.	Udo Ebert, Heinz Welsch

Influence of user characteristics on valuation of ecosystem services in Do√±ana Natural Protected Area (south-west Spain)	Environmental Conservation	2007	01	01	Economic valuation of ecosystem services by stated preferences techniques is usually used by policy-makers to develop environmental management practices. Critics of the contingent valuation (CV) method have argued that respondents are influenced by several factors, which mean that people do not apply economic motives in responding to CV questions. This study examines the influence of individuals' environmental behaviour and knowledge about the good concerned on the CV results and the CV problem of benefit aggregation in order to determine the extent of the hypothetical market. Here a CV study in the Do√±ana National and Natural Park (Spain) found that both individual environmental behaviour and knowledge influenced willingness to pay for sustaining specific ecosystem services provided by the biodiversity of Do√±ana. A distance-decay function was found, which determined the social benefits of the ecosystem services of Do√±ana. The study illustrates the importance of understanding non-economic motives behind values in order to obtain further information which can support decision-making in environmental management.

Living on the Edge: Residential Property Values in the Urban-Rural Interface	Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics	2007	01	01	This study estimates the contribution of both urban-rural fringe location and lake proximity on residential property values in three upstate counties of South Carolina through estimation of spatial hedonic housing price models. Location in the urban fringe and the urban-rural interface are found to have a positive impact on residential housing values relative to either urban or more rural locations. Lakes in the upstate contribute positively to housing values to the extent that the house has a view of a lake, lake access, or lake frontage.	Molly Espey, Fahmida Fakhruddin, Lawrence R.

The Effect of NAFTA on Energy and Environmental Efficiency in Mexico	Policy Studies Journal	2007	01	01	Prior to Mexico's entry to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), predictions of the consequent impact on the environment in that country ranged from the dire to very optimistic. This article investigates NAFTA's outcomes in terms of energy use and the emission of atmospheric pollutants. Specifically, has entry into NAFTA led to a convergence or divergence in indicators of emissions, environmental efficiency, and emissions-specific technology in Mexico, the United States, and Canada? A battery of tests is applied to these indicators for energy use and carbon, sulfur, and NOx emissions in the three countries. The results show that the extreme predictions of the outcomes of NAFTA have not materialized. Rather, trends that were already present before the introduction of NAFTA continue and, in some cases, improve post-NAFTA, but not yet in a dramatic way. There is strong evidence of convergence across the three countries toward a lower intensity of energy use and emissions per unit of GDP. Although intensity is rising initially for some variables in Mexico, it eventually begins to fall post-NAFTA. Per capita emissions of sulfur and NOx also show convergence, but this is not the case for energy and carbon, and the latter variables also drift moderately upwards. The state of technology in energy efficiency and sulfur abatement is improving in all countries, although there is little, if any, sign of convergence and NAFTA has no effect on the rate of technology diffusion. However, total energy use and carbon emissions increase both pre- and post-NAFTA and total NOx emissions increase in Mexico. Only total sulfur emissions are stable and falling in all three NAFTA partners.	David I. Stern
Global Resources and Eco-labels: a Neutrality Result	Review of International Economics	2007	01	01	I evaluate the effectiveness of eco-labeling programs that are designed to mitigate transboundary environmental problems. A simple two-country model is considered, where consumers in each country value a common environmental resource. It is shown that, in equilibrium, the level of damage is independent of whether one or both countries have eco-labeling policies. Hence, the implementation of an existing eco-labeling program by a second country may have no effect, or a very limited effect, on the stock of the environmental resource. The result highlights potential limitations of eco-labeling policies in this international context.	Peter E. Robertson
Valuation of the Woopo Wetland in Korea: a contingent valuation study	Environment and Development Economics	2007	01	01	A contingent valuation (CV) method was performed to estimate the conservation value of the Woopo Wetland, Ramsar site, in Korea. The CV survey was rigorously designed to comply with the guidelines for best-practiced CV studies. Respondents overall accepted the hypothetical market and were willing to pay a significant amount (2,731 to 3,960 Korean won = USD 2.10 to 3.05), on average, per household annually to conserve the wetland. These findings have important implications for efforts to consider environmental quality in policy decisions.	SEUNG-JUN KWAK, SEUNG-HOON YOO, CHUNG-KI LEE
Modelling sulphur emissions in Europe: a spatial econometric approach	Oxford Economic Papers	2007	01	01	Previous authors have described an acid rain game in which countries respond to transboundary depositions of sulphur by adjusting their domestic emissions. Multiple attempts to model environmental Kuznets curves for sulphur emissions over time, however, have ignored the theoretical dependency of emissions on transboundary depositions. This neglect is surprising since in Europe there are numerous examples of countries whose own contribution to domestic depositions is less than the contribution from foreign emissions. Within the context of a long panel of sulphur emissions for European countries it is shown that accounting for transboundary emissions markedly alters the perceived shape of the environmental Kuznets curve. Far more compelling however is a model characterized by a spatial lag in which countries simply track changes in the per capita emissions characteristics of their neighbours irrespective of their per capita income levels.

The determinants of environmental innovation: the impacts of environmental policies on the Nordic pulp, paper and packaging industries	European Environment	2007	01	01	Innovations may have positive societal effects such as improved environmental performance, and they are often portrayed as solutions to environmental problems. However, the mechanisms through which innovations develop and the ways in which public incentives support improved environmental performance of innovations are complex. This paper uses empirical cases to examine how environmental policies, market factors and technological push affect process and product innovations in the Nordic pulp, paper and packaging industries. The results show that environmental improvements in technologies and products are simultaneously driven by all three of these factors. Environmental innovations are often developed in anticipation of future policy or as side-effects of existing policies. However, while environmental policy directly influences process innovations, its connection to product innovations is less clear. The study points towards the importance of gradually tightening and predictable environmental policies that are flexible enough to allow the exploration of new technological developments.

Dynamic Use of Closures and Imperfectly Enforced Quotas in a Metapopulation	American Journal of Agricultural Economics	2007	01	01	The dynamic efficiency of closures in bioeconomic systems depends upon stock levels and in situ values that evolve over time, and on relative costs of implementation. A model of a harvested metapopulation is presented in which second-best reduction of harvest from open-access levels using input quotas balances monitoring costs against dynamic benefits of mitigating overharvesting. Temporary or permanent closures-though generally still second best-are preferable to quotas under certain conditions, as demonstrated for a representative patch and time period. Interactions between patches are discussed. Numerical solutions illustrate comparative dynamics of closure use, and show their potential benefits in a dynamic regulatory path.	Guillermo E. Herrera

Sustainable tourist behaviour - a discussion of opportunities for change	International Journal of Consumer Studies	2007	01	01	Research shows that despite their declared positive attitudes towards sustainable tourism, only a few tourists act accordingly by buying responsible tourism products, choosing environmentally friendly transportation or behaving responsibly towards destination communities. The low support from customers is one of the main barriers for progress towards sustainable tourism. One reason can be that existing initiatives are missing customers' attention, discouraging industry and governments to continue promoting sustainable tourism. Positive attempts to encourage sustainable consumption in other sectors indicate that specific barriers may reside in the nature of tourist choices. Taking a critical look at tourism research and literature, this article examines the interplay between reasons for tourists' choice of products and services, and environmental motivations. After identifying possible gaps that may explain current failures to stimulate responsible tourist choices, the article concludes by discussing the implications for the effectiveness of informative and awareness-raising tools aimed to facilitate the shift towards responsible tourist behaviour and actions.

Decomposing the Value of Agricultural Multifunctionality: Combining Contingent Valuation and the Analytical Hierarchy Process	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2007	01	01	Agricultural multifunctionality is the recognition of the joint exercise of economic, environmental and social functions by this sector. Nevertheless, not all these contributions to society are valued in markets, moreover a large share of them are public goods. For this reason, in order to make this concept of multifunctionality operative for the design of public policies, it is necessary to estimate the social demand of such functions. The objective of this article was to implement an empirical application along these lines. For this purpose, the agricultural system of cereal steppes in Tierra de Campos in Spain is taken as a case study. The economic valuation technique used relies on a combined implementation of contingent valuation and the analytical hierarchy process. The results obtained demonstrate the existence of a significant demand for the different attributes included in the multifunctionality concept, although this demand is heterogeneous and is based on the socioeconomic characteristics of individual persons.

Designing frameworks to deliver unknown information to support market-based instruments	Agricultural Economics	2007	01	01	This article reports on an Australian auction to procure multiple environmental outcomes: EcoTender. EcoTender uses a Catchment Modelling Framework (CMF) to estimate the impact landholder actions have on carbon, terrestrial biodiversity, aquatic function (water quality and quantity), and saline land area. This framework solves the problem of linking paddock-scale land use and management to catchment-scale environmental outcomes. This is the first time a market-based instrument has been fully integrated from desk to field with a biophysical model for the purchase of multiple environmental outcomes. A multiple outcome auction provides several new economic and scientific challenges. This article discusses the EcoTender approach to incorporating agency preferences, modeling the joint production of environmental outcomes and reporting environmental scores. Results indicate that linking EcoTender to the carbon market reduced the cost of procuring the environmental goods by 26%. Further, preliminary estimates show that the environmental gains from scoring the joint production of multiple outcomes are between 30% and 50% to the agency.

Do Environmental Regulations Cost Jobs? An Industry-Level Analysis of the UK	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2007	01	01	This paper revisits the 'jobs versus the environment' debate and provides the first analysis for a country other than the US. We firstly examine the impact of environmental regulations on employment assuming such regulations are exogenous. However, for the first time in a study of this nature, we then allow environmental regulation costs and employment to be endogenously determined. Environmental regulation costs are not found to have a statistically significant effect on employment whether such costs are treated as being exogenous or endogenous. We therefore find no evidence of a trade-off between jobs and the environment.	Matthew A Cole, Rob J Elliott
Testing Choice Experiment for Benefit Transfer with Preference Heterogeneity	American Journal of Agricultural Economics	2007	01	01	Benefit transfer is a cost-effective method for estimating the value of environmental goods that relies on information obtained in previous studies. The multiattribute approach of choice experiments should provide advantages in terms of benefit transfer, allowing differences in environmental improvements between sites as well as differences in socioeconomic and attitude characteristics between respondent populations. This article investigates the capability of choice experiment method to be used in environmental benefit transfer when a random parameters approach is used to allow for preference heterogeneity: we find that the inclusion of respondents' taste heterogeneity reduces the magnitude of the transfer error.

Taxation of fertilizers, pesticides and energy use for agricultural production in selected EU countries	European Environment	2007	01	01	This study examines the differences in taxation of specific means of agricultural production such as fertilizers, pesticides, mineral oil products, gas and electricity in selected EU nations. Apart from the description of relevant tax rules prevailing in these countries, an international comparison of tax burden on profit, which is caused by the combination of the individual tax regulations, is made based on a model entity. Such a comparison identifies the distortion led by the taxation on agricultural firms' business performance and their competitiveness. Copyright ¬© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sustainable consumption and resource management in the light of life cycle thinking	European Environment	2007	01	01	Approaches to address unsustainable ways of societal development constantly proliferate, but total consumption of resources and aggregate environmental impacts continue rising. This could partially be explained by weak attempts to develop comprehensive sustainability strategies that address the entire life cycle of products and especially resource extraction and use phases. This paper seeks to explore to what extent these life cycle stages and associated impacts are taken into account when various actors employ life cycle thinking and how these concerns can be better attended to in policy-making, business strategies and lifestyle choices. To accomplish this, we evaluate the efforts of the main stakeholders in reaching sustainable consumption and sustainable resource management, and impediments to further progress, and study whether and how deficits in these phases coincide and can potentially contribute to more holistic practical realization of life cycle thinking. We demonstrate that new approaches are needed to be able to tackle the international dimension of production and consumption. Copyright ¬© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

10th Anniversary Focus: From mainstream environmental economics to sustainability economics. On the need for new thinking	Journal of Environmental Monitoring	2008	01	01	Traditional ideas of science as being separate and separable from ideology and politics have to be reconsidered. Each interpretation of sustainable development is not only scientific but at the same time ideological. For this reason our ideas about good science should also be related to normal imperatives of democracy. Mainstream neoclassical economics is specific in scientific and ideological terms. This paradigm is useful for some purposes and has played a role as a mental map in guiding us towards economic growth and other ideas about progress in society and the economy. Sustainable development, however, represents an ideological turn in our ideas about progress and it is no longer clear that neoclassical theory will be enough. Alternative perspectives in economics are being developed as part of a pluralistic strategy and the monopoly position of neoclassical economists at university departments of economics is thereby challenged. A political economic person is suggested as alternative (complement) to Economic Man assumptions and a political economic organization to be compared with the neoclassical profit maximizing firm. Alternative ways of understanding markets and international trade, efficiency, decision-making, monitoring and assessment are also needed. It is argued that such an alternative mental map is useful for actors who take the challenge of sustainable development seriously.	Peter Sderbaum
Debt, democratization, and development in Latin America: How policy can affect global warming	Journal of Policy Analysis and Management	2008	01	01	"The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis conjectures a nonlinear relationship between pollution and economic growth, such that pollution per capita initially increases as countries economically develop, but then reaches a maximum point before ultimately declining. Much of the EKC literature has focused on testing this basic hypothesis and, in studies that find evidence of an EKC, estimating the ""turning point"" level of development at which the per capita pollution-growth relationship changes sign. This approach has not emphasized the policy relevance of specification issues or the potential role of policy variables. This research explores a modified EKC specification which conditions the pollution-growth relationship on a country's level of debt and degree of democratization. These variables turn out to be significant, implying that different political and economic contexts can shift EKCs and their turning points. These findings suggest that policies to relieve debt burdens and institute political reform, in addition to their usual justifications, also could be used as a strategy to reduce carbon emissions from developing countries. ¬© 2008 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management."

Predicting Resource Policy Outcomes via Meta-Regression: Data Space, Model Space, and the Quest for 'Optimal Scope'	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2008	01	01	"Resource-managing agencies are increasingly relying on secondary data to predict economic benefits for planned policy interventions. This 'transfer of benefits' is often based on a quantitative synthesis of aggregate results for similar past interventions via Meta-Regression Models. However, this approach is generally plagued by the paucity of available studies and related small sample problems. A broadening of scope of the Meta-Regression Model by adding data from ""related, yet different"" contexts or activities may circumvent these issues, but may not necessarily enhance the efficiency of transfer functions if the different contexts do not share policy-relevant parameters. We illustrate how different combinations of contexts can be interpreted as 'data spaces' which can then be explored for the most promising transfer function using Bayesian Model Search techniques. Our results indicate that model-averaged benefit predictions for scope-augmented data spaces can be more robust and efficient than those flowing from the baseline context and data."

Real options for precautionary fisheries management	Fish and Fisheries	2008	01	01	The 1996 Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) 'Guidelines on the Precautionary Approach to Fisheries and Species Introduction' raise important issues for fisheries managers, but fail to prescribe an approach for risk management. The distinguishing characteristics of the 'precautionary approach' are the inclusion of uncertainty and 'an elaboration on the burden of proof'. The FAO precautionary approach emphasizes that managers should be risk-averse, but does not provide tools for determining the appropriate degree of risk aversion. Consequently, application of the precautionary approach often leads to decision-making based on ad hoc safety margins. These safety margins are seldom chosen with explicit consideration of trade-offs. If the emphasis was shifted to choosing between competing uncertainties, then managers could manage risk. By attempting to avoid risk, managers may gain exposure to other risks and perhaps miss valuable opportunities. We place fishery management problems within the rubric of 'real investment' problems, and compare and contrast the consideration of risk by alternative investment frameworks. We show that traditional investment frameworks are inappropriate for fishery management, and furthermore, that traditional precautionary approaches are arbitrary and without basis in decision theory. Quantitative decision-making techniques, such as formal decision analysis (FDA), enable integration of competing hypotheses that help alleviate burden-of-proof issues. These techniques help analysts consider sources of uncertainty. FDA, however, can still be subject to arbitrary safety margins because such analyses often focus on determining which strategies best achieve, or avoid, targets that have been established without complete consideration of trade-offs. A managerial finance approach, real options analysis (ROA), is an alternative and complementary decision-making technique that enables managers to compute precautionary adjustments that couple the size of the 'safety margin' with the amount of uncertainty, thereby optimizing risk exposure and avoiding the need for arbitrary safety margins. We illustrate the advantages of an approach that combines FDA and ROA, using a heuristic example about a decision to re-introduce Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) into Lake Ontario. Finally, we provide guidance on applying ROA to other fishery problems. The precautionary approach requires that managers consider risk, but considering risk is not the same as managing it. Here ROA is useful.	Eli P Fenichel, Jean I Tsao, Michael L Jones, Graham J Hickling
Decomposing the CO2-income tradeoff: an output distance function approach	Environment and Development Economics	2008	01	01	The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis holds that economic growth leads to increases in pollution in early stages of development, but is a significant driver of environmental improvements as income levels increase. Most empirical applications have focused on estimating a reduced form equation in which the measure of environmental degradation is posited as a non-linear function of income. In this paper we develop a structural production model based on an output distance function to investigate the EKC hypothesis for CO2 in a panel of industrialized countries from 1971 to 2000. This structural approach allows for the decomposition of the observed emission changes into the scale, composition, and productivity effects, thus providing additional insight into the interlinked processes of economic growth and environmental change. The findings from our preferred model indicate that for most countries, the CO2-saving productivity effect is not large enough to offset the CO2-producing scale effect.	JON P. REZEK, KEVIN ROGERS

Environmental Protection and Trade Liberalization in a Small Open Dual Economy	Review of Development Economics	2008	01	01	The author investigates the conditions under which environmental protection and trade liberalization might improve urban unemployment and welfare in a small open Harris-Todaro model with polluting urban manufacturing. While a tariff reduction decreases manufacturing employment, a rise in the pollution tax rate may increase it when a dirty input is complementary to capital. Environmental protection and trade liberalization are consistent in reducing the level of urban unemployment because they lower it under the same condition. They are consistent in increasing GDP if a rise in the pollution tax rate decreases manufacturing employment. Otherwise, trade liberalization will mitigate a decrease in GDP because of environmental protection if the degree of urbanization is low and if rural technology exhibits weak diminishing returns to labor. This GDP effect plays a central role in welfare improvement.	Ichiroh Daitoh
Ecocultural Attributes: Evaluating Ecological Degradation in Terms of Ecological Goods and Services Versus Subsistence and Tribal Values	Risk Analysis	2008	01	01	"It is becoming increasingly clear that scientists, managers, lawyers, public policymakers, and the public must decide how to value what is provided by, and is a consequence of, natural resources. While ""Western"" scientists have clear definitions for the goods and services that ecosystems provide, we contend that these categories do not encompass the full totality of the values provided by natural resources. Partly the confusion results from a limited view of natural resources derived from the need to monetize the value of ecosystems and their component parts. Partly it derives from the ""Western"" way of separating natural resources from cultural resources or values, and partly it derives from the false dichotomy of assuming that ecosystems are natural, and anything constructed by man is not natural. In this article, we explore the previous assumptions, and suggest that because cultural resources often derive from, and indeed require, intact and unspoiled natural ecosystems or settings, that these values are rightly part of natural resources. The distinction is not trivial because of the current emphasis on cleaning up chemically and radiologically contaminated sites, on restoration of damaged ecosystems, on natural resource damage assessments, and on long-term stewardship goals. All of these processes depend upon defining natural resources appropriately. Several laws, regulations, and protocols depend upon natural resource trustees to protect natural resources on trust lands, which could lead to the circular definition that natural resources are those resources that the trustees feel they are responsible for. Where subsistence or tribal peoples are involved, the definition of natural resources should be broadened to include those ecocultural attributes that are dependent upon, and have incorporated, natural resources. For example, a traditional hunting and fishing ground is less valued by subsistence peoples if it is despoiled by contamination or physical ecosystem degradation; an Indian sacred ground is tarnished if the surrounding natural environment is degraded; a traditional homeland is less valued if the land itself is contaminated. Our argument is that intact natural resources are essential elements of many cultural resources, and this aspect requires and demands adequate consideration (and may therefore require compensation)."

RELIEF FOR THE ENVIRONMENT? THE IMPORTANCE OF AN INCREASINGLY UNIMPORTANT INDUSTRIAL SECTOR	Economic Inquiry	2008	01	01	Deindustrialization, stagnant real incomes of production workers, and increasing inequality are latter day features of many economies. It is common to assume that such developments pressure policymakers to relax environmental standards. However, when heavily polluting industries become less important economically, their political importance also tends to diminish. Consequently, a regulator may increase the stringency of environmental policies. Like some other studies, we find that declining industrial employment translates into stricter environmental standards. In contrast to previous studies, but consistent with our argument, we find that greater income inequality is associated with policies that promote a cleaner environment.

Dynamic Inefficiency in an Overlapping Generation Economy with Pollution and Health Costs	Journal of Public Economic Theory	2008	01	01	We analyze an overlapping generations model in which pollution arises, in an accumulatively way, from production. Householders do not care directly about the environment, but pollution leads them to incur health costs when they are elderly. We show that the presence of pollution means that the economy more likely to be dynamically inefficient. For these cases we analyze two kinds of tax scheme: one based on production taxes and the other based on capital and wage taxes. We show how to design both schemes to put the economy into the golden rule allocation. We also show that under the production tax scheme young and elderly agents pay less taxes (or receive more transfers) than under the production tax system.	MAR√çA‚ÄêJOS√â GUTI√âRREZ
Ein Unm√∂glichkeitstheorem f√ºr die Klimapolitik?	Perspektiven der Wirtschaftspolitik	2008	01	01	Abstract: Climate policy is the field where economists have a prime opportunity to polish their image of being dismal scientists. Economic analysis shows that the difficulties in fighting global warming are overwhelming. Attempts to coordinate greenhouse gas reductions internationally are undermined by powerful free rider incentives. Moreover, if some countries, against all odds, succeed in agreeing on a climate treaty the success is jeopardized by the leakage effect. Doesn't economic theory provide any basis for optimism? This article digs up some hopeful aspects. Among those are risk aversion and induced technical progress.	Alfred Endres
Public policy and corporate environmental behaviour: a broader view	Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management	2008	01	01	Corporate strategies to manage the business-ecological environment interface have evolved against the backdrop of regulatory pressures and stakeholder activism. Despite its relevance with respect to sustainable development, a well developed theory encompassing all aspects of corporate environmental behaviour, especially incorporating incentive compatible public policy measures, is yet to be developed. This paper is a step in this direction, aiming to assimilate contributions related to different aspects of corporate environmental behaviour, capturing the transition from environmental management to environmental strategy. In the process we identify areas where there is a need for further research. We find that there is plenty of scope in developing more complex models to explain a manager's rationale for adopting sustainable strategies in the backdrop of the policy regime, and in conducting more empirical (both descriptive and quantitative) work to obtain clearer insights into managerial decisions.

Agricultural Exports and the Environment: A Cross-National Study of Fertilizer and Pesticide Consumption	Rural Sociology	2008	01	01	Abstract The mass consumption of agrochemicals, including manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, by industrialized agricultural systems worldwide threatens human health and the health of ecosystems. The production of these agricultural inputs is a highly energy- and capital-intensive process, and their application contributes to a variety of direct and indirect impacts on the environment. This study is an analysis of the relationships between international trade in agricultural products and the consumption of these synthetic compounds. Using OLS regression models and data from World Bank and UNFAO, we analyze cross-national data to examine the relationship between structural factors, such as economic development and export intensity, and both fertilizer and pesticide consumption. The findings are considered from the opposing theoretical perspectives of international political economy (IPE) and neo-liberal modernization (NLM). The results generally support the claims of IPE and contradict those of NLM, indicating that increases in exports of agricultural products contribute to increases in fertilizer and pesticide consumption within nations. These results call into question policies that promote increased trade liberalization in agricultural products.	Stefano Longo, Richard York

DAMS, DAM REMOVAL, AND RIVER RESTORATION: A HEDONIC PROPERTY VALUE ANALYSIS	Contemporary Economic Policy	2008	01	01	This article presents the results of a hedonic property value analysis for multiple hydropower sites along the Kennebec River in Maine, including the former site of the Edwards Dam in Augusta, Maine. The effect of the removal of the Edwards Dam on the Kennebec River in Maine is examined through consumer's marginal willingness to pay to be close to or distant from the dam site. Data from both before and after the dam was removed are used to estimate changes in marginal prices. A similar data set is also used to look at the effects of the remaining upstream dams on property values. This article presents one of the first (to our knowledge) ex post analyses on the economic impact of dam removal on property values. As more privately owned dams in the United States come up for relicensing, evaluating the impacts with and without the dam will become increasingly important. This work can help inform those analyses. (JEL Q25, Q51, Q58)	LYNNE Y. LEWIS, CURTIS BOHLEN, SARAH WILSON
Household willingness-to-engage in water quality projects in western Newfoundland and Labrador: a demand-side management approach	Water and Environment Journal	2008	01	01	This paper aims to measure household willingness-to-engage (WTE) in municipal water quality projects. A cross-sectional logit model is specified as a function of socio-demographic, socio-economic, water consumption and conservation, and public awareness in western Newfoundland and Labrador. WTE is a new provision of the demand-side management approach that incorporates an ecological economics dimension to water use. The results show that the levels of education and annual family income have positively affected households' decisions to get involved in the municipal water quality projects. In addition, the degree of public awareness has a significant impact on shaping the households' decisions.	Gabriela Sabau, Morteza Haghiri
Integrated environmental product innovation and impacts on company competitiveness: a case study of the automotive industry in the region of Munich	European Environment	2008	01	01	This paper examines the impact of integrated environmental product innovations on company competitiveness. In a regional case study about automotive, rail and commercial vehicle firms in Southern Germany it is found that integrated environmental product innovation is driven by factors such as regulatory pressure, the search for competitive advantages and technological lead as well as customer pressure. Regulatory pressure includes sector policies, such as emission standards, and wider non-sector energy conservation issues, at both national and international levels. For instance, EU directives on future use of renewable energy as well as national goals for reaching the Kyoto protocol play an important role in driving innovation. The study finds that integrated environmental product innovations driven by regulatory pressure produce similar competitiveness impacts as innovations undertaken voluntarily by companies. Such results yield supporting evidence for the so-called 'Porter hypothesis', which assumes that environmental legislation stimulates innovation and leads to 'win-win' situations - the simultaneous reduction of pollution and increase in productivity.

The sustainability spectrum and the sciences of sustainability	Business Strategy and the Environment	2008	01	01	Understanding sustainability requires integrating multiple perspectives and investigative methods to explain multidimensional concepts. However, the traditional approach to research and education is organized along disciplinary lines that tend to exclude awareness of contributions in one field that may inform problems in another. This presents a serious obstacle to advancing an understanding of sustainability, which is focused on the interactions between industrial and ecological systems, rather than examining each system independently. This paper offers a broad description of different perspectives with regard to sustainability including security, reliability, resilience and renewal, and briefly describes the emerging sciences essential to understanding sustainability: ecological economics, industrial ecology, ecosystem health, and sustainable decision making, policy and design. In the latter, the challenges have yet to find an academic locus. Nonetheless, it is in this area that knowledge of sustainability science must be applied and it is consequently most proximate to business leaders, policy makers and designers.

VALUING BLUE FLAG STATUS AND ESTUARINE WATER QUALITY IN MARGATE, SOUTH AFRICA	South African Journal of Economics	2008	01	01	This study estimates the costs associated with reduced water quality and withdrawal of Blue Flag status in Margate, Kwazulu-Natal, based on travel costs and contingent behaviour (reported change in visits contingent on a hypothetical scenario). Costs associated with hypothetical loss of Blue Flag status (based on reduced visits) range between R17 and R25 million per annum. Interestingly, Blue Flag status was withdrawn shortly after completion of the survey, owing to reduced water quality. This study therefore provides an estimate of the associated welfare losses, and of the benefits of actions to improve water quality and restore Blue Flag status.	Anton Nahman, Dan Rigby

A Benefit-Cost Analysis of Total Maximum Daily Load Implementation	JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association	2008	01	01	Abstract: Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) implementation generates benefits and costs from water quality improvements, which are rarely quantified. This analysis examines a TMDL written to address bacteria and aquatic-life-use impairments on Abrams and Opequon Creeks in Virginia. Benefits were estimated using a contingent valuation survey of local residents. Costs were based on the number and type of best management practices (BMPs) necessary to achieve TMDL pollution reduction goals. BMPs were quantified using watershed-scale water quality simulation models (Generalized Watershed Loading Function and Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN). Based on our projections, the costs to achieve TMDL induced pollution reduction goals outweigh the estimated benefits. Benefit-cost ratios ranged between 0.1 and 0.3.

Environmental and Pro-Social Norms: Evidence on Littering	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2009	01	01	The paper investigates the relationship between pro-social norms and its implications for improved environmental outcomes. This is an area, which has been neglected in the environmental economics literature. We provide empirical evidence to demonstrate a small but significant positive impact between perceived environmental cooperation (reduced public littering) and increased voluntary environmental morale. For this purpose we use European Values Survey (EVS) data for 30 European countries. We also demonstrate that Western European countries are more sensitive to perceived environmental cooperation than the public in Eastern Europe. Interestingly, the results also demonstrate that environmental morale is strongly correlated with several socio-economic and environmental variables. Several robustness tests are conducted to check the validity of the results.	Benno Torgler, Bruno S. Frey, Clevo Wilson

How Cognitive Biases Can Affect the Performance of Eco-Labeling Schemes	Journal of Agricultural & Food Industrial Organization	2009	01	01	Individuals exhibit systematic cognitive biases which make their behavior 'deviant' when compared to the benchmark of perfectly rational individuals. The person's tendency to make errors in judgment based on cognitive factors, are thought to be based upon heuristics and lead to decisions that are sub-optimal. Ignoring cognitive biases can affect diverse dimensions of eco-labeling policies and lead to flawed prescriptions. We review several cognitive biases that affect eco-labeling related behaviors and show how taking them into account allows a better understanding of eco-labeling schemes and informs policy makers in order to design and implement more effective eco-labeling policies.

VALUATION OF WILDLIFE: REVISING SOME ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR SCOPE TESTS	Contemporary Economic Policy	2009	01	01	In this article, we build on previous valuation studies to contribute to the understanding of preferences toward conservation of endangered species elicited via willingness to pay. In particular, we assess the effect of the existence of biological substitutes of local endangered species. We also incorporate biological concepts such as the minimum viable population level into the valuation scenario. Furthermore, the role of ethical and environmental beliefs and their relationship with preferences toward conservation levels are explored. Results are discussed and contrasted with previous studies.

Carbon emissions in Central and Eastern Europe: environmental Kuznets curve and implications for sustainable development	Sustainable Development	2009	01	01	This study examines the impact of various factors such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, energy use per capita and trade openness on carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per capita in the Central and Eastern European Countries. The extended environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) was employed, utilizing the available panel data from 1980 to 2002 for Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Turkey. The results confirm the existence of an EKC for the region such that CO2 emission per capita decreases over time as the per capita GDP increases. Energy use per capita is a significant factor that causes pollution in the region, indicating that the region produces environmentally unclean energy. The trade openness variable implies that globalization has not facilitated the emission level in the region. The results imply that the region needs environmentally cleaner technologies in energy production to achieve sustainable development. Copyright ¬© 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Can attitudes predict outcomes? Public opinion, democratic institutions and environmental policy	Environmental Policy and Governance	2009	01	01	The 'post-materialist' value hypothesis, positing heightened concern for the environment, should predict eventual convergence in environmental policies. In the meantime, surprisingly wide variations persist, even when controlling for income levels. Is there a role for public opinion to explain better the divergences and outcomes observed in environmental policies? This paper explores a possible mechanism by which widely hypothesized income effects on policy can occur via pressure from public opinion. By building upon a median-voter model of environmental policy-making and developing an extension to include voter-information characteristics, we test these effects on air pollution outcomes of varying (global, regional and local) scales. The results provide evidence of significant effects, but suggest two antecedent conditions necessary for political and opinion variables to have an effect: redistributive opportunities, and credible frameworks for addressing collective action problems. The implication is that relying on democratic reform alone may not suffice to improve environmental performance if underlying collective action problems are not addressed.

China's industrial SO2 emissions and its economic determinants: EKC's reduced vs. structural model and the role of international trade	Environment and Development Economics	2009	01	01	This paper discusses the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for the case of China's industrial SO2 emissions: both its reduced form and structural model are considered. The EKC curve for China's per capita industrial SO2 emissions predicts the turning point at 10,000 yuan (3,085 US$, Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)). However, given China's fast population expansion, the decreasing trend in per capita emissions may well not be enough to bring about an immediate reduction in terms of total industrial SO2 emissions and emissions density. Using the structural EKC model makes it possible to reveal how various factors contribute to the industrial SO2 emissions density - namely, the three commonly known structural determinants and the marginal impact of international trade. International trade proves to have a two-fold impact: a significantly negative direct one and an indirect one that is dependent on the current capital-labour abundance ratio and on the income level of each province.

Dichotomous-choice contingent valuation with 'dont know' responses and misreporting	Journal of Applied Econometrics	2009	01	01	A new approach is presented that simultaneously deals with Misreporting and Don't Know (DK) responses within a dichotomous-choice contingent valuation framework. Utilising a modification of the standard Bayesian Probit framework, a Gibbs with Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to estimate the posterior densities for the parameters of interest. Several model specifications are applied to two contingent valuation datasets: one on wolf management plans, and one on the US Fee Demonstration Program. We find that DKs are more likely to be from people who would be predicted to have positive utility for the bid. Therefore, a DK is more likely to be a YES than a NO. We also find evidence of misreporting, primarily in favour of the NO option. The inclusion of DK responses has an unpredictable impact on willingness-to-pay estimates, since it impacts differently on the results for the two datasets we examine.

Agrofuels and Agrifoods	Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society	2009	01	01	The economically successful model of industrial agriculture that is currently expanding throughout Argentina is leading to deep social, economic, environmental, and logistical changes that are seriously restricting the sustainability of the rural, urban and environmental systems. The transformation of activities, the arrival of new technologies, the arrival of organizations with large financial and technological capabilities, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of small-scale and medium-scale farmers and their reallocation to new productive functions are not only affecting the social sustainability of the rural sector but are affecting the urban communal plots of villages and towns located on the Chacopampeana Plain. Now, the production of agrofuels as a response to international global demand will promote the ecological and social depletion that Argentina has been facing from the beginning of the 1990s. We argue in terms of ecological economics that externalities should be included in the costs of companies, not just economic costs.	Walter A. Pengue
Integrated Water Resources Optimization Models: An Assessment of a Multidisciplinary Tool for Sustainable Water Resources Management Strategies	Geography Compass	2009	01	01	Integrated water resources optimization models (IWROM) are tools that have been developed over the last decade for determining optimal water allocations among competing sectors. This article describes the state of the art of IWROMs. We illustrate the various approaches that have been taken to determine and maximize economic benefits of withdrawing water for various use categories in IWROM applications, including off-stream human uses and in-stream uses such as ecological flows. First, we describe the hydrologic simulators used in IWROM applications, and the mathematical methods used to solve the optimization problems. It is suggested that IWROMs (a) seek to model coupled human-nature relationships and mimic the impact of water resources management strategies on the environment at the basin scale; (b) allow for the simulation and assessment of economic policies and strategies on water resources management; (c) can support basin-wide decision-making; and (d) are particularly useful for water-scarce regions. Finally, we have identify the need for improvements in (a) simulating biophysical systems; (b) handling model uncertainty; (c) inclusion of environmental flows and other relevant environmental factors through economic benefit functions; (d) accounting for social impacts related to shifts in water allocations among users; and (e) inclusion of stakeholders in the development of IWROMs.	Alex Mayer, Andrea Mu√±oz‚ÄêHernandez
Material Worlds: Natural Resources, Resource Geography and the Material Economy	Geography Compass	2009	01	01	This article lays out a set of arguments about natural resources, the material economy, and resource geography. It explains the productive position resources occupy in the organization of knowledge and establishes 'natural resources' as a potent social category for designating parts of the non-human world to which value is attached. The article then elaborates two claims: (1) that we live in a material world in which 'the economy' is fundamentally - although not exclusively - a process of material transformation through which natural resources are converted into a vast array of commodities and by-product wastes; and (2) that the material economy of resource production, transformation and consumption is one of contradiction and paradox. The bulk of the article outlines seven specific resource paradoxes: scale/quality, complexity/risk, scarcity/abundance, value/intensity, diversity/dependence, wealth/poverty, intimacy/ignorance - and explains what they reveal about the geographical and historical dynamics of resource production and consumption.

Experimental methods for environment and development economics	Environment and Development Economics	2009	01	01	Many poor countries remain trapped in a cycle of poverty and environmental degradation. Understanding how people react to existing and proposed solutions most likely can be improved using the methods of experimental economics. Experiments provide researchers a method to test theory, look for patterns of behavior, testbed economic institutions and incentives, and to educate people. Herein we explore how experimental economics has been used and could be used to help guide decision making to increase prosperity without overexploiting the resource base and environmental assets needed for basic survival.

Park Location Affects Forest Protection: Land Characteristics Cause Differences in Park Impacts across Costa Rica	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2009	01	01	To support conservation planning, we ask whether a park's impact on deforestation rates varies with observable land characteristics that planners could use to prioritize sites. Using matching methods to address bias from non-random location, we find deforestation impacts vary greatly due to park lands' characteristics. Avoided deforestation is greater if parks are closer to the capital city, in sites closer to national roads, and on lower slopes. In allocating scarce conservation resources, policy makers may consider many factors such as the ecosystem services provided by a site and the costs of acquiring the site. Pfaff and Sanchez 2004 claim impact can rise with a focus upon threatened land, all else equal. We provide empirical support in the context of Costa Rica's renowned park system. This insight, alongside information on eco-services and land costs, should guide investments.	Alexander Pfaff, Juan Robalino, G. Arturo Sanchez-Azofeifa, Kwaw S Andam, Paul J Ferraro
Sulfur dioxide emissions and per capita income: a disaggregation of the effects of long-run and short-run income growth	Environment and Development Economics	2009	01	01	This paper investigates the links between growth in gross domestic product (GDP) and sulfur dioxide emissions by disaggregating income growth into long-term growth (the trend of GDP over time) and short-term growth (income fluctuations around the trend). Results indicate a substantial fixed component of sulfur dioxide emissions. Once income fluctuations are controlled for, the effect of changes in the scale of the economy over time can be distinguished from the effects of the changing composition of output and the state of technological development. Results indicate that at low levels of income, the composition and technology effects are associated with an increase in emissions; for high levels of income, the composition and technology effects are associated with a leveling off of emissions.

"INDIVIDUAL SPECIES-STATE ANALYSIS OF NATURESERVE'S ""AT-RISK"" CATEGORIES: HUNTING AND FISHING'S ROLE"	Contemporary Economic Policy	2009	01	01	"We examine the impact of hunting and fishing on rankings in NatureServe's 2005 ""at-risk"" list using 24,291 observations on individual vertebrate animal species for 47 states (we omit Alaska, Hawaii, and Missouri).

We control for species type (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and turtles), population density, farming area, forest cover, coastline existence, endemism, and per capita income. We find that states with higher hunting and fishing participation (or higher per capita expenditures) have fewer ""at-risk"" species. States with larger per capita big game spending have fewer ""at-risk"" non-big game species. States with larger wildlife agency budgets have fewer endangered species.(JEL Q57)"	MICHAEL NIESWIADOMY, DAVID N. LABAND
Public Values for River Restoration Options on the Middle Rio Grande	Restoration Ecology	2009	01	01	"River restoration is a widespread phenomenon. This reflects strong public values for conservation, though missing are studies explicitly justifying restoration expenditures. Public restoration benefits are not well quantified, nor are public preferences among diverse activities falling into the broad category ""restoration."" Our study estimates public values for restoration on the Middle Rio Grande, New Mexico. Stakeholder meetings and public focus groups guided development of a restoration survey mailed to Albuquerque area households. Four restoration categories were defined: fish and wildlife; vegetation density; tree type; and natural river processes. Survey responses supplied data for both choice experiment (CE) and contingent valuation (CV) analyses, two established environmental economics techniques for quantifying public benefits of conservation policies. Full restoration benefits are estimated at over $150 per household per year via the CE and at nearly $50 per household per year via CV. The CE allows value disaggregation among different restoration categories. The most highly valued category was tree type, meaning reestablishing native tree dominance for such species as Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and eradicating non-native trees such as Saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissma). The high public values we have found for restoration offer economic justification for intensive riparian management, particularly native plant-based restoration in the Southwest."	Matthew A.

PESSIMISM OR OPTIMISM: A JUSTIFICATION TO VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY	Australian Economic Papers	2009	01	01	This article analyses the determinants of voluntary contribution to environmental quality by introducing the perception of environmental risk. We consider individuals who are aware both of the impact of their voluntary contributions and of the quality of the current environment on the future quality of environment. Their preferences are represented by the RDU model. We distinguish three kinds of effect: environmental quality, wealth and risk perception. The first effects are not always sufficient to explain agents' implication in the improvement of environmental quality.	JOHANNA ETNER, MEGLENA JELEVA, PIERRE‚ÄêANDRE JOUVET
Sustainable development with stock pollution	Environment and Development Economics	2009	01	01	Optimal pollution control is an important challenge for sustainable development with three distinct cases. First, the situation where nature's assimilative capacity is completely destroyed involves normative problems that require further research. Second, environmental restoration with initial pollution above the steady-state stock requires an economy to initially allocate a relatively high share of its resources to cleaning-up activities. In return, this generally results in an intertemporally efficient development path that is both environmentally and economically sustainable. Third, optimal trajectories in situations with initial stocks of pollution below the long-term optimum generally imply an increase in pollution and a decline of optimal consumption. In this case, the investment of the environmental rents accruing from nature's assimilative capacity into man-made capital is required in analogy to the famous Hartwick rule to maintain a constant flow of instantaneous welfare. This would facilitate growth in consumption sufficient to compensate for the rising disutility of pollution.	WERNER HEDIGER

Local communities empowered to plan?	Action Research	2009	01	01	This article presents the second cycle of an ongoing participatory action research (PAR) project that aimed at facilitating bottom-up, sustainability planning and development in one of the most socio-economically disadvantageous micro-regions of Hungary. The process at the very beginning started as conventional qualitative research, and gradually emerged to a PAR process as deeper relationships with local people were developed and previous research practices and research focus were questioned. Current institutional changes, such as the availability of European Union funding for rural development and the micro-regional re-districting driven both by top-down and bottom-up processes, were structural factors that created a more promising context for participatory planning. Although a PAR project generally targets silenced groups, for this to happen it is arguably necessary to legitimize such development work in the eyes of local decision-makers and funding organizations, in order to establish more inclusive communicative spaces around future rural development. However, this also creates a controversial situation: breaking away from prevailing structural inequalities and hierarchies remains difficult through a process which is designed around consensus-building.

Non-renewable resource depletion and reinvestment: issues and evidence for an oil-exporting country	Environment and Development Economics	2009	01	01	This essay offers a limited study of income sustainability for one oil-exporting country: Iraq. The nature of the study motivates a discussion of some theoretical issues concerning levels of non-renewable resource depletion and re-investment as well as related questions about the substitutability of man-made and natural capital and critical natural capital. The results of the study, which decomposes oil revenues into consumption and capital portions, suggest that the re-investment in physical capital offset the depletion of natural assets arising from oil extraction in the period under consideration. Because of the lack of data, a complete study of the capital balance is not feasible. Consequently the findings are tentative.	BASSAM YOUSIF
Testing the Consistency Between Standard Contingent Valuation, Repeated Contingent Valuation and Choice Experiments	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2009	01	01	Choice experiments (CEs) are a relatively new approach to valuing environmental resources. Initial tests of the validity of the approach have either compared benefit estimates generated using CEs with those estimated using contingent valuation (CV) or used more sophisticated hypothesis tests of parameter equality. Although useful, existing tests have been restricted to testing consistency based on a single policy scenario (standard CV). We argue that, although these tests are informative, they fail to take full advantage of the richness of CE data. In particular, CE data allow for the calculation of benefit estimates over a range of policy scenarios (i.e. attribute combinations). A similar range of benefit estimates may be generated by pooling scenarios in a repeated CV study. In this paper, we explore this relationship between CV and CEs by conducting validity tests between a CE model and a repeated CV model over a range of three levels of improved water quality at Clear Lake, IA, USA. Evidence from this test suggests that the CE and CV data are consistent.	Mike Christie, Christopher D. Azevedo
USING HAPPINESS DATA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL VALUATION: ISSUES AND APPLICATIONS	Journal of Economic Surveys	2009	01	01	Abstract In addition to standard methods of environmental valuation, a novel approach has recently emerged which models individuals' self-rated happiness as a function of their incomes and the prevailing environmental conditions. The estimated relationship is used to calculate the trade-off people would be willing to make between income and environmental conditions, i.e. the increase in income necessary to compensate individuals for any given decline in environmental quality. While the basic idea is simple, the theoretical and empirical details may be complex, and they may vary from application to application. This paper discusses the relevant conceptual and methodological issues and reviews applications to air and water pollution, noise nuisance, climate parameters, and natural hazards.

Exploring perspectives of environmental best management practices in Thai agriculture: an application of Q-methodology	Environmental Conservation	2009	01	01	In Thailand, horticultural practices are a significant source of non-point source (NPS) pollution, and the government is considering best management practices (BMPs) as control measures for reducing agricultural NPS pollution to water. A prevailing assumption that farmers' reactions to regulations will be homogenous is not based on underlying insights into attitudinal positions that may explain alternative behavioural responses. This paper uses Q-methodology to identify attitudinal discourses relating to BMP uptake. The approach combines the strengths of qualitative and quantitative research in order to explore subjectivity. The study is conducted with citrus growers in the Ping river basin, where farmers are facing increasing competition from alternative water uses. Four 'discourses' or viewpoints are identified, namely conservationist, traditionalist, disinterested and risk-averse. The different attitudes of these four groups are likely to be associated with distinctive behavioural reactions to the adoption of alternative policy instruments for pollution control. These discourses could usefully inform targeted policies for the control of NPS pollution from agriculture.	WIMOLPAT BUMBUDSANPHAROKE, DOMINIC MORAN, CLARE HALL

In Search of Environmental Spillovers	World Economy	2009	01	01	There is an extensive literature that examines the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and the productivity and competitiveness of domestic firms. Using estimation techniques from the productivity spillover literature, this paper tests for the presence of environmental spillovers from foreign firms. On the basis that foreign-owned firms may encourage firms in their extended supply chain to improve their environment-related management practices, evidence for the existence of environmental spillovers should be easier to find than productivity spillovers where firms naturally attempt to minimise intra-industry knowledge leakage. In this paper we show that, first, foreign-owned firms are more likely to implement environmental management systems (EMS) and, second, that the presence of foreign-owned firms in those sectors that a firm supplies can encourage good environmental practice. This is especially true if a firm is foreign, has high absorptive capacity, and operates in the presence of formal and informal networks.	Facundo Albornoz, Matthew A. Cole, Robert J. R.

Counterfactual thinking and impact evaluation in environmental policy	New Directions for Evaluation	2009	01	01	Impact evaluations assess the degree to which changes in outcomes can be attributed to an intervention rather than to other factors. Such attribution requires knowing what outcomes would have looked like in the absence of the intervention. This counterfactual world can be inferred only indirectly through evaluation designs that control for confounding factors. Some have argued that environmental policy is different from other social policy fields, and thus attempting to establish causality through identification of counterfactual outcomes is quixotic. This chapter argues that elucidating causal relationships through counterfactual thinking and experimental or quasi-experimental designs is absolutely critical in environmental policy, and that many opportunities for doing so exist. Without more widespread application of such approaches, little progress will be made on building the evidence base in environmental policy. ¬© Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	Paul J. Ferraro
Indirect assessment of economic damages from the Prestige oil spill: consequences for liability and risk prevention	Disasters	2009	01	01	The social losses arising from the Prestige oil spill exceed the compensation granted under the IOPC (International Oil Pollution Compensation) system, with losses estimated at 15 times more than the applicable limit of compensations. This is far above the level of costs for which those responsible for hydrocarbons spills are liable. The highest market losses correspond to sectors of extraction, elaboration and commercialisation of seafood. However, damages to non-commercial natural resources could constitute an outstanding group of losses for which further primary data are needed: these losses would only be compensable under the current system by means of a refund for cleaning and restoration costs. Results show that, in Europe, the responsibility for oil spills in maritime transport is limited and unclear. The consequence of this is net social losses from recurrent oil spills and internationally accepted incentives for risky strategies in the marine transport of hydrocarbons.

Technology Diffusion, Product Differentiation and Environmental Subsidies	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2009	01	01	This paper explores the relationship between environmental subsidies, the diffusion of a clean technology, and the degree of product differentiation in an imperfectly competitive market. Like others, we show that the subsidy succeeds in reducing environmental damage only when the substitution effect (the reduction in pollution associated with the clean technology) exceeds the output effect (the extent that the subsidy increases output). Here, we add product differentiation and diffusion dynamics. When the substitution effect dominates, environmental damage decreases monotonically during the diffusion process. The extent of technology diffusion (the degree to which clean technology replaces dirty) is decreasing in the degree of product differentiation. Further, as products become closer substitutes, it is more likely that the subsidy will reduce environmental damage. Finally, the subsidy for clean technology will spill over to the remaining dirty producers, increasing their profit as well. In a free-entry equilibrium, the subsidy decreases pollution when product differentiation is low compared to the relative pollution intensity of the clean technology.

Chapter 5 - Natural Capital and Ecosystem Services: The Ecological Foundation of Human Society	Ecosystem Services	2010	01	01	Ecosystems provide both the energy and materials needed for the production of economic goods and services and act as a sink of wastes generated by the economic metabolism. Other nature's services benefits are obtained directly from nature, often without passing through transformation processes or the mediation of markets, as in the case of clean air, erosion control, aesthetic benefits, or climate regulation. Economic health in the long term thus depends on the maintenance of the integrity and resilience of the natural ecosystems in which it is embedded. The fact that standard economic theory neglects this aspect has been identified as a main cause of the current environmental problems and ecological crises. Approaches such as ecological and environmental economics attempt to deal with these shortcomings of standard economics through the development of concepts and accounting methods that better reflect the role of nature in the economy and the ecological costs derived from economic growth. Concepts such as natural capital, ecosystem functions and ecosystem services are playing a key role as tools to communicate societal dependence on natural ecosystems and in the articulation of a new form of understanding economics. This paper gives a brief overview of the key concepts for understanding the links between ecosystems and human well-being, and discusses a range of valuation and accounting methods as possible ways to measure the quantities and importance of natural capital and ecosystem services.

Measuring sustainability under regime shift uncertainty: a resilience pricing approach	Environment and Development Economics	2010	01	01	This paper is concerned with the theory of resilience pricing and sustainability measurement in the presence of risk for regime shift in a dynamic economy-environment system. Following Holling (Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, vol. 4, 1973, pp. 1-23), we consider resilience as the maximal perturbation that the system can absorb without flipping into a qualitatively different state. Using a multisector growth model under uncertainty, we derive the shadow price of resilience that affects the probabilities of the system to flip in the future. We also analyze the role of resilience on sustainability with both ex-ante and ex-post welfare measures.	KARL-G√ñRAN M√ÑLER, CHUAN-ZHONG LI
The economics of biodiversity: the evolving agenda	Environment and Development Economics	2010	01	01	This paper assesses how the economics of biodiversity, as a field, has evolved in response to developments in biodiversity science and policy over the life of the journal, Environment and Development Economics. Several main trends in the economics of biodiversity are identified. First, biodiversity change has come to be analyzed largely through its impact on ecosystem services (in the sense of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment). Second, there has been a growing focus on factors that optimally lead to biodiversity decline, i.e., the benefits to be had from reducing the abundance of pests, predators, pathogens, and competitors. Third, increasing attention is being paid to two global drivers of biodiversity change, climate and global economic integration, and the effect they have on the distribution and abundance of both beneficial and harmful species. Fourth, there has been growing interest in the development of instruments to deal with the transboundary public good aspect of biodiversity, and in particular in the development of payments for ecosystem services. The paper identifies the influence of these trends on attempts to model the role of biodiversity in the production of goods and services.	CHARLES PERRINGS
Public Expenditure, Environment, and Economic Growth	Journal of Public Economic Theory	2010	01	01	This paper attempts to develop a model of endogenous growth with special consideration to the role of productive public expenditure in the presence of congestion effect of private capital and environmental pollution. We analyze the properties of the optimal fiscal policy in the steady-state equilibrium when the level of production of the final good is the source of emission. Government allocates its income tax revenue between pollution abatement expenditure and productive public expenditure. In the steady-state equilibrium, optimum ratio of productive public expenditure to national income is less than the competitive output share of the public input; and this ratio varies inversely with the magnitude of the emission-output coefficient. The steady-state equilibrium appears to be a saddle point; and the market economy growth rate is not necessarily less than the socially efficient growth rate in the steady-state equilibrium.

The science of ecological economics	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2010	01	01	The Ecological Economics journal is a primary source for inquiry on ecological economics and sustainability. To explore the scholarly pursuit of ecological economics, we conducted a content analysis of 200 randomly sampled research, survey, and methodological articles published in Ecological Economics during the 15-year period of 1989-2004. Results of the analysis were used to investigate facets of transdisciplinarity within the journal. A robust qualitative approach was used to gather and examine data to identify themes representing substantive content found within the span of sampled journal papers. The extent to which each theme was represented was counted as well as additional data, such as author discipline, year published, etc. Four main categories were revealed: (1) foundations (self-reflexive themes stemming from direct discussions about ecological economics); (2) human systems, represented by the themes of values, social indicators of well-being, intergenerational distribution, and equity; (3) biophysical systems, including themes, such as carrying capacity and scarcity, energy, and resource use, relating directly to the biophysical aspects of systems; and (4) policy and management encompassing themes of development, growth, trade, accounting, and valuation, as well as institutional structures and management. The results provide empirical evidence for discussing the future direction of ecological economic efforts.	Valerie A.

Policy Strategies to Promote Eco-Innovation	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2010	01	01	This article elaborates an integrated policy framework, including policy features and specific measures that can be implemented to mitigate the barriers to eco-innovations. We claim that factors inhibiting the development and uptake of eco-innovations are multifaceted and stem from different sources. This systems view, which highlights the multilayered conception of the obstacles to eco-innovation, calls for a combination of environmental and technology policies adapted to the different barriers and characteristics of the technologies. Drawing on evolutionary economics, the article sheds light on the appropriate combinations of framework conditions and instruments that are most effective to promote eco-innovation, considering different barriers and eco-innovation types (process/product, mature/immature, and radical/incremental).

METHODS, TRENDS AND CONTROVERSIES IN CONTEMPORARY BENEFIT TRANSFER	Journal of Economic Surveys	2010	01	01	Abstract Benefit transfer uses research results from pre-existing primary research to predict welfare estimates for other sites of policy significance for which primary valuation estimates are unavailable. Despite the sizable literature and the ubiquity of benefit transfer in policy analysis, the method remains subject to controversy. There is also a divergence between transfer practices recommended by the scholarly literature and those commonly applied within policy analysis. The size, complexity and relative disorganization of the literature may represent an obstacle to the use of updated methods by practitioners. Recognizing the importance of benefit transfer for policymaking and the breadth of associated scholarly work, this paper reviews and synthesizes the benefit transfer literature. It highlights methods, trends and controversies in contemporary research, identifies issues and challenges facing benefit transfer practitioners and summarizes research contributions. Several areas of future research on benefit transfers naturally emerge.	Robert J. Johnston, Randall S. Rosenberger
The Demand for Seafood Eco-Labels in France	Journal of Agricultural & Food Industrial Organization	2010	01	01	The French fishing industry has a long history and its seafood market a wide variety of products. Despite the worldwide growth in ecolabelling schemes over the past decade, the French industry has only very recently shown an interest in such schemes. Growing consumer and retailer awareness of environmental issues in France has changed the situation and it is now of interest to look at the demand for seafood ecolabelling in relation to the public perception of commercial fishing.We analyse, using an ordered Probit model, the factors influencing consumer demand for seafood ecolabelling on the basis of a French survey carried out on more than 1000 consumers. Our results show a significant relationship between the acceptability of ecolabelling and certain purchase criteria. The production process characteristics in (origin, wild vs. farmed, level of natural stocks) impact more strongly on the demand for ecolabelling than product attributes (form, visual appeal, freshness). Consumers are also influenced more by regulation than by information, inaccurate or otherwise, they may have about the fishing industry. Finally, our analysis confirms a higher demand for ecolabelling from young, educated consumers, particularly those living in non-coastal areas.

On the Measurement of Welfare for Market and Nonmarket Goods: A Numerical Approach	American Journal of Agricultural Economics	2010	01	01	Extending Vartias (1983) framework, the paper presents a simple numerical approach to the measurement of welfare for market and nonmarket goods on the basis of an incomplete (mixed) demand system. The method allows the determination of exact welfare measures. It provides a flexible and well-founded alternative to ad hoc methods based on consumer surplus.	Udo Ebert
Cost-effective provision of environmental services: the role of relaxing market constraints	Environment and Development Economics	2010	01	01	Ferraro and Simpson (2002) argue that when markets are competitive, payments for environmental services (PES) are more cost-effective in achieving environmental goals than more indirect approaches such as subsidies to capital. However, when eco-entrepreneurs face non-price rationing in input or output markets, as is typical for credit in developing countries for example, we show that interventions which relax constraints can be more cost-effective than PES. One corollary of this is that such indirect approaches are preferred to PES by interveners (e.g., donors) and eco-entrepreneurs alike. Both of these outcomes are more likely when constraints are severe. This has implications for schemes with dual environment and poverty alleviation objectives.	BEN GROOM, CHARLES PALMER
Poverty, development, and environment	Environment and Development Economics	2010	01	01	This paper examines the complex relationship that exists between poverty and natural resource degradation in developing countries. The rural poor are often concentrated in fragile, or less favorable, environmental areas. Consequently, their livelihoods can be intimately dependent on natural resource use and ecosystem services. The relationship between poverty and natural resource degradation may depend on a complex range of choices and tradeoffs available to the poor, which in the absence of capital, labor, and land markets, is affected by their access to outside employment and any natural resource endowments. The paper develops a poverty-environment model to characterize some of these linkages, and concludes by discussing policy implications and avenues for further research.	EDWARD B. BARBIER
Information disclosure and environmental regulation: Green lights and gray areas	Regulation & Governance	2010	01	01	This research examines the potential of information disclosure for environmental regulation. The research attempts to answer questions of what impact information disclosure has on corporate environmental practices and what interferes with its effective use. A case study of Indonesia's pioneering informational environmental regulation reveals (i) both indirect (e.g. anticipation of external pressure) and direct (e.g. internal learning support) informational effects that enhance environmental awareness at the top management level and stimulate changes in production processes and (ii) detrimental effects of disclosed information that maintain or strengthen the extant power of regulated firms over environmental groups and local communities affected. Regulatory efforts can be leveraged by public disclosure of information regarding firms' environmental performance, especially where the state monitoring and enforcement capacities are weak. However, the introduction of policies of this kind without consideration of different market conditions and political and administrative culture may impede the effectiveness of this potentially useful regulatory method.

Managing correlated stock externalities: water taxes with a pinch of salt	Environment and Development Economics	2010	01	01	This paper addresses the design of corrective taxation schemes to manage multiple, interacting stocks. In the setting of irrigation-induced salinity, a collective groundwater stock aliments a set of individual rootzone salt stocks. It is shown that the policy maker does not need to base the tax rule on the individual salt stocks. Indeed, taxes based on the level of input and on the collective stock induce the agents to achieve the socially optimal irrigation path. An even simpler instrument is sufficient if the policy-maker's goal is to reach optimality at the steady state only.	SOPHIE LEGRAS

INFORMATION DISCLOSURE POLICIES: EVIDENCE FROM THE ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY	Economic Inquiry	2010	01	01	"While theory suggests that information programs may correct market failures and improve welfare, the empirical impacts of these policies remain undetermined. We show that mandatory disclosure programs in the electricity industry achieve stated policy goals. We find that the proportion of fossil fuels decreases, and the proportion of clean fuels increases in response to disclosure programs. However, the programs may produce unintended consequences. For example, programs may make ""clean"" firms cleaner, while leaving ""dirty"" firms relatively unchanged. If the marginal benefits of pollution abatement are larger at dirty firms than at clean firms, disclosure programs may induce inefficient abatement allocations.

Standard Oriented Environmental Policy: Cost-Effectiveness and Incentives for 'Green Technology'	German Economic Review	2010	01	01	Abstract. In their seminal 1971 paper, W. J. Baumol and W. E. Oates analyzed effluent charges and 'command and control' regarding their ability to attain a given standard of environmental quality at minimum cost. In the subsequent literature,transferable discharge permits (TDPs) have been added to the portfolio of standard oriented environmental policy instruments. We place these instruments in a dynamic context. Here, cost minimization is defined in an intertemporal setting allowing for induced technical change. It turns out that the relative performance of alternative policy instruments regarding their 'dynamic cost-effectiveness' crucially depends on the information available to the involved agents. Under adverse informational conditions,only a TDP system with future markets is dynamically cost-effective.	Alfred Endres, Bianca Rundshagen
Exporting and Environmental Performance: A Firm-level Productivity Analysis	World Economy	2010	01	01	The objective of this paper is to study empirically the relationship between export orientation and firms' environmental performance from different perspectives of trade theory. On the one hand, productivity heterogeneity is analysed within the new trade-theoretical framework. The approach followed is to determine firm-level productivity components, including an environmental productivity indicator (as a performance measure) and taking as reference the Spanish food industry. On the other hand, from the traditional comparative advantage perspective, this study also develops an export performance model to evaluate the effect of technology, environmental variables and factor endowment on exporting. The results show greater environmental productivity and corporate efficiency for export-oriented firms. Our findings also determine the positive effect on firms' export intensity of environmental performance as a factor of specialisation and technology proficiency.	Emilio Galdeano‚ÄêG√≥mez
The Chernobyl Disaster, Concern about the Environment, and Life Satisfaction	Kyklos	2010	01	01	The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster on satisfaction with life and on concern about the environment. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study and identifying the exogenous event through the exact date of occurance, I find that concern about the environment sharply increased immediately after the incident. However, there is no effect on individuals' satisfaction with life in general. This suggests that, though people in Germany were aware of the severity of the incident, the concept of life satisfaction reflects a rather personal perspective on life.	Eva M. Berger

Closure strategies as a tool for fisheries management in metapopulations subjected to catastrophic events	Fisheries Management and Ecology	2010	01	01	Abstract Spatial management measures in the form of no-take areas used in fisheries management can provide a buffer against catastrophic events. Dynamic area closures, like rotational closures, have also been used as a management tool particularly for sessile organisms. In this study, bioeconomic models are developed to investigate dynamic closure strategies for use as a management tool in the harvest of a metapopulation consisting of two local sub-populations. The models provide an optimal strategy that maximises the sum of discounted net returns with a fixed harvest level [i.e. total allowable catch (TAC)] by opening and closing the sub-populations of a metapopulation, subject to random negative catastrophic effects. Results showed the optimal policy for opening and closing a single exploited population depends on the degree and pattern of migration between it and other sub-populations. When the harvest or TAC can be applied to either sub-population, the optimal closure strategy depends on the abundance of both populations, crucially, even if they are biologically independent. The results provide insights into the management of stochastically fluctuating populations including more mobile species that are frequently not subject to no-take controls.	L. R. LITTLE, R. Q.

Accounting for Respondent Uncertainty to Improve Willingness-to-Pay Estimates	Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie	2010	01	01	"In this paper, we develop an econometric model of willingness to pay (WTP) that integrates data on respondent uncertainty regarding their own WTP. The integration is utility consistent, there is no recoding of variables, and no need to calibrate the contingent responses to actual payment data, so the approach can ""stand alone."" In an application to a valuation study related to whooping crane restoration, we find that this model generates a statistically lower expected WTP than the standard contingent valuation (CV) model. Moreover, the WTP function estimated with this model is not statistically different from that estimated using actual payment data suggesting that, when properly analyzed using data on respondent uncertainty, CV decisions can simulate actual payment decisions. This method allows for more reliable estimates of WTP that incorporate respondent uncertainty without the need for collecting comparable actual payment data. Dans le pr√©sent article, nous avons √©labor√© un mod√®le √©conom√©trique d'estimation qui internalise l'incertitude des r√©pondants quant √† leur propre consentement √† payer. L'internalisation est fid√®le √† la notion ""d'utilit√©""; il n'a pas √©t√© n√©cessaire de transformer les variables ni de calibrer les r√©ponses des r√©pondants avec des paiements r√©els.

Dans une √©tude d'√©valuation sur le r√©tablissement de la grue blanche d'Am√©rique dans laquelle ce mod√®le a √©t√© utilis√©, nous avons trouv√© que le consentement √† payer attendu √©tait statistiquement plus faible que celui obtenu √† l'aide de la m√©thode d'√©valuation contingente standard. Par ailleurs, la fonction de consentement √† payer estim√©e √† l'aide de ce mod√®le n'est pas statistiquement diff√©rente de celle estim√©e √† l'aide de paiements r√©els. Cette observation autorise √† penser que, lorsque le mod√®le tient compte des donn√©es sur l'incertitude des r√©pondants, les d√©cisions obtenues √† l'aide de la m√©thode d'√©valuation contingente peuvent simuler les d√©cisions obtenues √† l'aide de paiements r√©els.

The Value of Land Use Patterns and Preservation Policies	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2010	01	01	In many communities, land-use and open-space preservation have become important concerns. Using a large dataset containing every home sale in the state of Massachusetts over 8 years, this paper simultaneously measures the impact of the mix of land-uses in the immediate neighborhood of a home on property values and the impact of a locally-implemented program, the Community Preservation Act (CPA), which provides funds for local open-space and historic preservation as well as affordable housing. I exploit the panel nature of the dataset to conduct a difference-in-differences analysis using local as well as house level fixed effects to overcome omitted variables bias. My results indicate that, on average, passage of the CPA reduces property values by about 1.5% in Massachusetts towns. However, when I allow the CPA effect to differ by county, I find some heterogeneity -- it increases property values in some communities and reduces them in others. Variation in local spending priorities appears to have little impact on property values or the effect of the CPA. Finally, I find that cropland and pasture, as well as low-density residential development, are the most preferred local land-uses, and that homes are more expensive as one increases distance to highways and active rail lines.

Evidence on the interjurisdictional competition for polluted industries within China	Environment and Development Economics	2010	01	01	This study examines, with a focus on regional environmental states in China, whether regional latecomers suffer the domestically created 'pollution haven' effect through the interjurisdictional competition for polluted industries within China, or enjoy the spillover effect of nationwide progress in environmental management and technology, using the analytical framework of the environmental Kuznets curve. The study found that the regional latecomer's advantage was verified in the case of wastewater, while its disadvantage was identified in waste gas and solid waste. We speculate that the contrasting result on regional latecomer's effects between wastewater, waste gas, and solid waste comes from the difference in policy performances: the well-designed water pollution control may have regional latecomer's enjoy the spillover effect of nationwide progress, while the ineffective control of air and solid waste pollution may cause a 'pollution haven' effect through the interjurisdictional competition for polluted industries on regional latecomers.

Environmental Economics: How Agricultural Economists Helped Advance the Field	American Journal of Agricultural Economics	2010	01	01	In this essay we examine the coevolution and cross-fertilization of environmental and agricultural economics over the past century. We discuss the key role that agricultural economists have played in the intellectual development of environmental economics. We focus on three primary contributions: incentive design, nonmarket valuation, and joint determination. The nature of these contributions is illustrated using specific examples from the literature. Agricultural economists tendency to focus on applied problems has enriched and broadened both the academic debates and the policy advice provided by economists.	Catherine L.

Integrating Environmental Protection and EU Competition Law: Why Competition Isn't Special	European Law Journal	2010	01	01	One of the biggest challenges facing environmental policy makers at present is that of integrating environmental protection goals into economic policy areas. Unless this is genuinely achieved, it is clear that environmental degradation will continue apace. Though one of the EU's most important areas of economic competence is competition policy, many policy makers and commentators reject the notion that environmental concerns should play a significant role in EU competition analysis. In that light, this article addresses two key questions. First, should this approach apply? Second, if not, what are the principles that govern how environmental protection requirements should be taken into account by decision makers applying EU competition law? In answering these questions, the article puts forward three theoretical arguments as to why, and how, the environmental benefits and damage flowing from goods and services should be taken into account by EU competition decision makers, based, respectively, on legal systematic, governance and economic reasoning.

Local strategic planning processes and sustainability transitions in infrastructure sectors	Environmental Policy and Governance	2010	01	01	Sustainability transitions have repeatedly been demanded in various economic sectors to confront global environmental problems. The present paper analyses the role of strategic planning processes for improving the prospects of achieving sustainable transitions in infrastructure sectors. Current planning approaches in these sectors tend to perpetuate the established socio-technical configurations by neglecting context uncertainties, by ignoring radical system alternatives and by focusing on narrow value considerations. In order to improve the prospects for sustainable transitions, more reflexive and discursive strategic planning methods are needed. We present the 'Regional Infrastructure Foresight' methodology as a specific procedural proposal and analyse results from its application to a case study in the Swiss sanitation sector.

Modelling the Risks Associated with the Increased Importation of Fresh Produce from Emerging Supply Sources Outside the EU to the UK	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2010	01	01	The risk of non-indigenous plant pests entering the UK via international trade in fresh produce is increasing. The objective of this article is to identify existing and emerging supply sources for UK fresh produce importers and examine the extent to which they could provide invasion pathways. We tested the hypothesis that increased imports of fresh produce from new sources outside the European Union could increase the risks of non-indigenous insect pests. We use a bio-economic model approach in which the number of species arrivals is a function of the volume of imports, whereas the volume of imports itself is a function of gross domestic product, relative import prices and seasonality. The study has identified clear trends, which show import volumes of fresh produce and species detections increasing from new supply sources. If this trend continues in the future, then the UK inspection agency should expect to confront species from new suppliers in much greater numbers, given that import volumes of fresh produce are income elastic.

Presidential Address: The Visible or Invisible Hand? The Balance Between Markets and Regulation in Agricultural Policy	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2010	01	01	The recent crisis in global financial markets has brought into question reliance on markets to determine the conduct of economic affairs and generated pressure for greater regulation and government control. Neither a neoliberal nor a neoregulatory approach is likely to be able to solve pressing problems affecting agriculture and natural resources, such as a deterioration in environmental quality and the challenge of climate change. To find solutions we need to employ a more realistic behavioural model than that typically used in economic analysis, and to recognise the key role played by values in individual and collective decision making. A more devolved approach to policy formation based on collective action seems to offer the greatest chance of success. More effort needs to be directed to understanding the drivers and processes of collective decision making, and how it can be harnessed to address pressing policy issues.	David Blandford
Connecting thermodynamics and economics	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2010	01	01	Almost 40 years have passed since Georgescu-Roegen's seminal work, The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. During this time there has been much debate on the relevance of thermodynamics to economics, and many attempts to build bridges between the two. There has also been much confusion as to what the laws of thermodynamics actually say. This article clearly explains heat, work, and the thermodynamic laws, the meaning of entropy, and the importance of kinetics as a barrier to thermodynamically favorable processes. The two most important misunderstandings in the literature, namely entropy as disorder, and entropy as a measure of information, are highlighted. Reviewing the literature shows that thermodynamics is most relevant for building a descriptive model, or preanalytic vision of economics, because it implies physical constraints on production and consumption. Similarly, it suggests that there may be serious flaws with neoclassical economic models, and in particular the primacy of sustained growth. However, thermodynamics does not seem to aid mathematical modeling in economics, nor does it provide normative insights. As an aid to energy policy, thermodynamics is useful for assessing the feasibility of technology options- those that have the potential to meet our goals, and should be counted as options, and those that should not. But it does not provide a prescription outside of this technical realm. Factors, such as environmental impact, cost, and social acceptability, will ultimately determine which technically feasible options are most desirable.	Mark David Glucina, Kozo Mayumi
Incorporating zero and missing responses into CVM with open-ended bidding: willingness to pay for blue skies in Beijing	Environment and Development Economics	2010	01	01	Based on decision theory, this paper suggests a four-hurdle model to deal with zero and missing responses in the contingent valuation method with open-ended bidding, which is used to analyze the willingness to pay for blue skies in Beijing where air pollution is known to be very serious. The mean and the median of the predicted willingness to pay for blue skies per household are, respectively, 120.15 and 128.60 yuan, less than 0.2% of the per capita annual disposal income in Beijing. This is very low compared to results from studies of other countries. The empirical results also indicate that the four-hurdle model is superior to the Tobit model and raw data estimation.

The Impact of Social Factors and Consumer Behavior on Carbon Dioxide Emissions in the United Kingdom	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2010	01	01	"In this article we apply geodemographic consumer segmentation data in an input-output framework to understand the direct and indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with consumer behavior of different lifestyles in the United Kingdom. In a subsequent regression analysis, we utilize the lifestyle segments contained in the dataset to control for aspects of behavioral differences related to lifestyles in an analysis of the impact of various socioeconomic variables on CO2 emissions, such as individual aspirations and people's attitudes toward the environment, as well as the physical context in which people act. This approach enables us to (1) test for the significance of lifestyles in determining CO2 emissions, (2) quantify the importance of a variety of individual socioeconomic determinants, and (3) provide a visual representation of ""where"" the various factors exert the greatest impact, by exploiting the spatial information contained in the lifestyle data. Our results indicate the importance of consumer behavior and lifestyles in understanding CO2 emissions in the United Kingdom. Across lifestyle groups, CO2 emissions can vary by a factor of between 2 and 3. Our regression results provide support for the idea that sociodemographic variables are important in explaining emissions. For instance, controlling for lifestyles and other determinants, we find that emissions are increasing with income and decreasing with education. Using the spatial information, we illustrate how the lifestyle mix of households in the United Kingdom affects the geographic distribution of environmental impacts."

Cumulative Effects and Emergent Properties of Multiple-Use Natural Resources	Multi-Agent-Based Simulation X	2010	01	01	Abstract: Quantifying cumulative environmental impacts (cumulative effects) is challenging due to complex dynamics of natural and human systems interacting. Cumulative effects in social-ecological systems are examples of emergent properties of complex systems, which arise from interactions between multiple resource users. The article presents a multi-agent-based simulation model designed to quantify cumulative effects in the case of interactions between forestry and hunting. The specific contributions of the paper are a) quantification of emergent properties in natural resource management systems, b) evaluation of different road decommissioning policies and the effect on game population sustainability, c) calibration of agent behaviours from numerous empirical studies. Preference weightings in the utility function of hunter agents are calibrated from stated and revealed preference studies of Canadian hunters. Simulations explore moose population sustainability under various forestry access management policies and with different hunter preference parameter configurations. Contrary to the intent of access management, earlier road decommissioning is found to negatively impact overall sustainability of game populations due to cumulative effects of aggregate hunter behaviour. Altering agents' preferences for travel cost, game populations, and hunter congestion result in dramatically different spatial outcomes for where game extirpations occur. Certain preference parameter settings create resonance between hunting pressure and game population growth, forming self-organized and persistent spatial resource use patterns.

Democratizing economics	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2010	01	01	"Climate scientists point to a number of unsustainable trends concerning the environment and natural resources. There is also ongoing concern about poverty reduction, labor rights, and other social aspects of sustainable development. Growing numbers argue that change is required, but still at issue is the extent of change and how to facilitate it. In this paper, the focus is on the dominant interpretive schema of influential actors with respect to ideas about science in society, paradigms in economics, and ideological orientations. The authors argue that the monopolistic position of neoclassical economics at university departments of economics in different parts of the world, and the spread of its associated technocratic logic within broader policy arenas, should be abandoned in favor of a more ideologically open attitude that facilitates discussion and debate within academia, public policy, and in civil society more generally. In a sense, economics requires ""democratization"" with implications for approaches to sustainability monitoring, accounting, and the assessment of projects and policies. The paper provides suggestions for developing sustainability assessment technologies and practices that take pluralism seriously."	Peter S√∂derbaum, Judy Brown
Pro-environmental behavior	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2010	01	01	The determinants of individual behaviors that provide shared environmental benefits are a longstanding theme in social science research. Alternative behavioral models yield markedly different predictions and policy recommendations. This paper reviews and compares the literatures from two disciplines that appear to be moving toward a degree of convergence. In social psychology, moral theories of pro-environmental behavior have focused on the influence of personal moral norms while recognizing that external factors, such as costs and incentives, ultimately limit the strength of the norm-behavior relationship. Rational choice models, such as the theory of planned behavior in social psychology and the theories of voluntary provision of public goods in economics, have sought to incorporate the effects of personal norms and to measure their importance in explaining behaviors, such as recycling and the demand for green products. This paper explores the relationship between these approaches and their implications for the theory and practice of ecological economics.	Rama Mohana R. Turaga, Richard B. Howarth, Mark E. Borsuk

The Impacts of Household Consumption and Options for Change	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2010	01	01	"This introductory article situates the contributions that comprise this special issue within the field of sustainable consumption and production (SCP) studies. After a brief review of the policy history surrounding SCP, we organize our discussion and the subsequent collection of articles into two groups. The first suite of articles views the environmental impacts associated with household consumption from the perspectives of different consumer groups, income levels, and geographic areas. This work confirms and refines several insights that have been developing over the past several years, namely that food and beverages, mobility, housing, and energy-using products are the most critical consumption domains from the standpoint of environmental sustainability and that higher household income leads to greater (but less than proportional) impacts. The second subset of articles analyzes the potential for mitigating these impacts through behavioral changes and innovation strategies. Although the contributions to this special issue describe several noteworthy examples of information- and team-based initiatives to catalyze behavioral changes, the state of knowledge pertaining to this aspect of the consumption problem is much more inchoate. Research on the formulation and implementation of effective ""change management for sustainable consumption"" should be treated as an area of priority attention for industrial ecologists."

Framing participation with multicriterion evaluations to support the management of complex environmental issues	Environmental Policy and Governance	2010	01	01	A repeated statement observed in the literature is that stakeholder participation can contribute to improve complex environmental management decisions. However, transparent and legitimate decision-making processes cannot be ensured without suitable involvement strategies and information treatments throughout the processes. The main goal in this study is to frame participatory processes with multicriterion evaluations to increase transparency of the decision support. The developed approach applies clearly defined roles of interest groups, experts and citizens, as well as alternatives presented on maps, criteria arranged in a hierarchy of decision elements and weights obtained by conducting deliberative processes with citizens. The approach is applied in a case study at municipal level in Norway to support coastal zone management decisions. Relevant interests and social values are systematically represented by the multicriterion evaluation framework utilized in the approach presented.

Social Ecological Economics: Understanding the Past to See the Future	American Journal of Economics and Sociology	2011	01	01	The attempt to provide insight into the interactions between the economy and the environment has been an on-going struggle for many decades. The rise of Ecological Economics can be seen as a positive step towards integrating social and natural science understanding by a movement that aims to go beyond the confines of mainstream economics towards a progressive political economy of the environment. However, this vision has not been shared by all those who have associated themselves with Ecological Economics and there has been conflict. An historical analysis is presented that shows the role of mainstream theory in delimiting the field of environmental research. The argument is put forward that rather than employing a purely mechanistic objective empirical methodology there is a need for an integrating interdisciplinarity heterodox economic approach. In order to distinguish this approach-from the more mainstream multidisciplinary linking of unreconstituted ecological and economic models-the name Social Ecological Economics is put forward as expressing the essential socio-economic character of the needed work ahead.

A Literature Review on the Links between Environmental Regulation and Competitiveness	Environmental Policy and Governance	2011	01	01	The effects of environmental regulation on competitiveness are under constant debate for policy-makers and practitioners. The following article reviews the different ways of defining and measuring the effects of environmental regulation on competition and market forces and synthesizes the most recent findings on the relationship between these dimensions. We find that two variables have proved to be both (1) key in defining to what extent and under what conditions environmental regulation exerts adverse or positive effects on competitiveness, and (2) difficult to nail down: forms of regulation and responses by business. The form of regulation may be as important as its stringency in determining the nature of its relationship with competitiveness. The relationship between environmental policies, environmental performance and competitiveness may also vary depending on the characteristics of the businesses and sectors concerned. Taking these factors in the methods of assessment into account may be crucial in understanding the nature of the relationship between environmental regulation and competitiveness.

Measuring the Impact of Anti-SLAPP Legislation on Monitoring and Enforcement	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2011	01	01	We examine changes in environmental monitoring and enforcement activity in the presence of state legislation prohibiting Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (anti-SLAPP laws). Using data on the Clean Air Act from the Environmental Protection Agency's ECHO database, we find evidence that state inspections increase by almost 50% after a state passes anti-SLAPP legislation. In addition, we find strong evidence that the ratio of findings of noncompliance to inspections more than doubles in the presence of anti-SLAPP legislation.

INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE AGREEMENTS UNDER INDUCED TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE	Metroeconomica	2011	01	01	We examine the impact of technological change on the stability of climate coalitions and explore how international cooperation on abatement affects the incentives of signatories to invest in R&D to reduce emissions. We compare the case of no technological change with exogenous technological change and induced technological change. In the latter case R&D investments are endogenous. We find that the highest equilibrium pay-offs are achieved in the case of induced technological change. Furthermore, the formation of a climate coalition boosts R&D investments in carbon abatement technologies in signatory countries.	Miyuki Nagashima, Hans‚ÄêPeter Weikard, Kelly de Bruin, Rob Dellink
Ecological economics of soil erosion: a review of the current state of knowledge	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2011	01	01	The economics of land degradation has received relatively little attention until recent years. Although a number of studies have undertaken valuation of ecosystem services ranging from the global to the micro level, and quite a few studies have attempted to quantify the costs of soil erosion, studies that address the full costs of land degradation are still scarce. In this review, we attempt to analyze different land resource modeling and valuation techniques applied in earlier research and the type of data used in these analyses, and to assess their utility for different forms of land resource and management appraisal. We also report on the strengths and weaknesses of different valuation techniques used in studies on the economics of soil erosion, and the relevance of these valuation techniques. We make a case for the need for more appropriate models that can make the analysis more robust in estimating the economic costs of land degradation while recognizing the spatial heterogeneity in biophysical and economic conditions.

COEVOLUTIONARY CONTRADICTIONS: PROSPECTS FOR A RESEARCH PROGRAMME ON SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE	Geografiska Annaler: Series B, Human Geography	2011	01	01	Insights from social system-environmental system coevolutionary thought experiments are abstract, mind opening, and can only be conveyed by leading readers through the experiment themselves. Undertaking applied coevolutionary analyses requires one to bound processes and fix some of the categories, contrary to the nature of the broad, opening nature of coevolution itself. Being conscious of these contradictions makes it difficult to engage in a sustained research programme or form a community of coevolutionary scholars. In this article we engage with the epistemological tensions of conducting coevolutionary research and put forward tentative strategies for managing them.	Richard B. Norgaard, Giorgos Kallis

The value of open ocean ecosystems: A case study for the Spanish exclusive economic zone	Natural Resources Forum	2011	01	01	Valuing goods and services from open oceans provides arguments for the ocean's protection and plays an increasingly important role in debates on the use and management of natural resources. This paper identifies and estimates the monetary value of some of the most important goods and services provided by open oceans. The list of goods and services considered includes food production, raw materials, water supply, CO2 regulation, bioremediation of waste, biomass and biodiversity conservation. Therefore, not only values associated with productive uses are quantified but also values assigned to other biological ecosystem services. This paper constitutes a first attempt in the open ocean literature at evaluating services such as water supply, biomass and biodiversity conservation. To obtain their monetary value, different techniques, some not applied before in this area, have been used depending on the ecosystem service to be evaluated. As a general criterion we use the concept of net value added (revenues obtained from the services less incurred costs). Our methodology is illustrated by estimating the monetary values of goods and services provided by the open ocean ecosystem of Spain as defined by its exclusive economic zone. The total economic value obtained measures the contribution of oceans to overall welfare and it may be an important instrument in managing open ocean ecosystems and developing environmental policies in the future.

The sustainability of green funds	Natural Resources Forum	2011	01	01	"This paper analyses the performance of the Dutch ""Green Funds Scheme"". This scheme is a policy instrument to advance green projects. The scheme relies on tax compensation for private investors who save or invest in green institutions below market returns. The green institutions select and monitor certified green projects and pass through part of the lower funding costs to investors. Certification of the green projects is based on environmental value-added and innovation. We provide a description of the characteristics of this incentive scheme and investigate the scheme's performance."	Bert Scholtens

POST KEYNESIAN PERSPECTIVES AND COMPLEX ECOLOGIC-ECONOMIC DYNAMICS	Metroeconomica	2011	01	01	This paper considers the implications of complex ecologic-economic dynamics for three broad, Post Keynesian perspectives: the uncertainty perspective, the macrodynamics perspective and the Sraffian perspective. Catastrophic, chaotic and other complex dynamics will be seen as reinforcing the conceptual foundations of Keynesian uncertainty. Predator-prey models will be seen as deeply linked to Post Keynesian macrodynamic models. Finally, certain cases in ecologic-economic systems will be seen as generating such Sraffian, capital theoretic conundra as reswitching. Ecologic-economic models considered besides predator-prey will include fisheries, forestry, lake dynamics and global climatic-economic dynamics.	J. Barkley Rosser, Jr
GROWTH, FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, AND THE ENVIRONMENT: EVIDENCE FROM CHINESE CITIES	Journal of Regional Science	2011	01	01	ABSTRACT In this paper, we investigate the relationship between economic growth and industrial pollution emissions in China using data for 112 major cities between 2001 and 2004. Using disaggregated data, we separate foreign direct investment inflows from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan from those of other foreign economies. We examine two industrial water pollution indicators (wastewater and petroleum-like matter) and four industrial air pollution indicators (waste gas, sulfur dioxide, soot, and dust). Our results suggest that most air and water emissions rise with increases in economic growth at current income levels. The share of output of domestic- and foreign-owned firms increases several pollutants in a statistically significant manner while output of firms from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan either reduces pollution or is statistically insignificant.

Generational Welfare under a Climate-Change Policy with Induced Innovation	The Scandinavian Journal of Economics	2011	01	01	We develop a climate-economy model with generational heterogeneity and with the potential for climate-policy-induced technological change. We use the model to assess the distributional implications of climate policies that recycle generated revenues to finance research and development in the energy sector. We show that while the investments of climate-policy rents that are used to accelerate innovation are likely to be welfare-improving, as long as significant market failures exist, they are also likely to exacerbate the distributional inequities created across generations by climate-change policies.

Environmental Policy, Innovation and Performance: New Insights on the Porter Hypothesis	Journal of Economics & Management Strategy	2011	01	01	"Jaffe and Palmer (1997) present three distinct variants of the so-called Porter Hypothesis. The ""weak"" version of the hypothesis posits that environmental regulation will stimulate environmental innovations. The ""narrow"" version of the hypothesis asserts that flexible environmental policy regimes give firms greater incentive to innovate than prescriptive regulations, such as technology-based standards. Finally, the ""strong"" version posits that properly designed regulation may induce cost-saving innovation that more than compensates for the cost of compliance. In this paper, we test the significance of these different variants of the Porter Hypothesis using data on the four main elements of the hypothesised causality chain (environmental policy, research and development, environmental performance, and commercial performance). The analysis draws upon a database that includes observations from approximately 4,200 facilities in seven OECD countries. In general, we find strong support for the ""weak"" version, qualified support for the ""narrow"" version, but no support for the ""strong"" version."

A Holistic vs. an Attribute-based Approach to Agri-Environmental Policy Valuation: Do Welfare Estimates Differ?	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2011	01	01	Different economic valuation methodologies can be used to value the non-market benefits of an agri-environmental scheme. In particular, the non-market value can be examined by assessing the public's willingness to pay for the policy outputs as a whole or by modelling the preferences of society for the component attributes of the rural landscape that result from the implementation of the policy. In this article we examine whether the welfare values estimated for an agri-environmental policy are significantly different between an holistic valuation methodology (using contingent valuation) and an attribute-based valuation methodology (choice experiment). It is argued that the valuation methodology chosen should be based on whether or not the overall objective is the valuation of the agri-environment policy package in its entirety or the valuation of each of the policy's distinct environmental outputs.

The policy challenges for green economy and sustainable economic development	Natural Resources Forum	2011	01	01	"Green growth, the promotion of energy efficiency and clean energy technologies and sustainable development are frequently viewed as complementary goals by international policymakers. This paper argues that green growth will not ensure sustainable economic development as long as global ecosystem degradation and loss means that the world continues to face worsening problems of ecological scarcity - the loss of myriad benefits, or ""services"", as these systems are exploited for human use and activity. Overcoming this problem requires addressing further sustainability and funding challenges. The sustainability challenge is to overcome a vast array of market, policy and institutional failures that prevents recognition of the economic significance of this scarcity. The funding challenge is to bridge the shortfall between the global benefits that humankind receives from ecosystems and what we are willing to pay to maintain and conserve them. Improving economic and scientific analysis of ecological scarcity, valuing the loss in benefits, and translating the implications into policy are the key steps for addressing the sustainability challenge. Exploring and implementing a range of innovative financing mechanisms, from international payments for ecosystem services to financial and currency transactions taxes to international financing facilities are possibilities for alleviating the funding challenge."

Farmer Compensation and its Consequences for Environmental Benefit Provision in the Higher Level Stewardship Scheme	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2011	01	01	The Environmental Stewardship Scheme (ESS) provides payments to farmers for the provision of environmental services based on forgone agricultural income. Consequently, farmers with a relatively low opportunity cost of agricultural land will be particularly attracted to apply for entry into the ESS within a given payment region. This article tests whether there exists a significant relationship between Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) Scheme entry and agricultural yields. Empirically, HLS participation is found to be negatively related to cereal yields at the farm level. This could be associated with 'auspicious selection' of land into the Scheme, with greater 'value for money' provided by the higher entry of land with lower agricultural forgone income but higher environmental benefit within the region.

The Optimal Time to Remove Quarantine Bans Under Uncertainty: The Case of Australian Bananas	Economic Record	2011	01	01	Import restrictions on biological materials are used widely as protection against exotic invasive pests and pathogens. While a scientific risk assessment is needed to justify an import ban under the WTO SPS Agreement, economics plays little role in determining the choice of import regime. Using a real option framework, we model the uncertain and irreversible costs from lifting an import ban and derive decision rules about the optimal timing, when ex ante research and development yields positive but uncertain benefits. The insights gained are applied to Australia's current import policy for bananas.	ANKE LEROUX, DONALD MACLAREN
Overcoming Barriers to Integrating Economic Analysis into Risk Assessment	Risk Analysis	2011	01	01	Regulatory risk analysis is designed to provide decisionmakers with a clearer understanding of how policies are likely to affect risk. The systems that produce risk are biological, physical, and social and economic. As a result, risk analysis is an inherently interdisciplinary task. Yet in practice, risk analysis has been interdisciplinary in only limited ways. Risk analysis could provide more accurate assessments of risk if there were better integration of economics and other social sciences into risk assessment itself. This essay examines how discussions about risk analysis policy have influenced the roles of various disciplines in risk analysis. It explores ways in which integrated bio/physical-economic modeling could contribute to more accurate assessments of risk. It reviews examples of the kind of integrated economics-bio/physical modeling that could be used to enhance risk assessment. The essay ends with a discussion of institutional barriers to greater integration of economic modeling into risk assessment and provides suggestions on how these might be overcome.	Sandra Hoffmann
Influence of International Openness on Corporate Environmental Performance in China	China & World Economy	2011	01	01	This paper examines how international openness influences China's corporate environmental performance. A unique firm-level dataset is constructed by combining two databases: the Annual Industrial Survey and the China GreenWatch Program Rating System. The empirical results obtained from a series of ordered probit models indicate that openness has a positive relation to corporate environmental performance in China. However, the two main market-opening strategies in China, exporting and attracting foreign investment, have different effects on environmental performance. The results reveal that foreign investment plays a substantial and positive role that can support the environmental spillovers in China. However, the effect of exporting is insignificant. The environmental pressure from foreign customers to improve Chinese firms' environmental performance presents a challenge. Our study indicates that China could make environmental quality improvements through increased international openness, as is likely the case for other developing countries.

The Success and Failure of An Inconvenient Truth and the Stern Report in Influencing Australian Public Support for Greenhouse Policy	Economic Record	2011	01	01	Longitudinal surveys were used to identify the effect of increased media climate change reporting because of An Inconvenient Truth, the Stern Report and drought. Results suggest that this was a catalyst for decreased support for policy action at low and moderate cost levels, while support marginally increased at higher costs. Similar results were found for additional information presented within questionnaire suggesting less engaged respondents chose the status quo if information was too complex, while others found the information strengthened the case for action. This highlights tension between ensuring debate is well informed and the risk of disengagement from presenting complex information.	MARK MORRISON, STEVE HATFIELD‚ÄêDODDS
Unitization of Spatially Connected Renewable Resources	The B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy	2011	01	01	Spatial connectivity of renewable resources induces a spatial externality in extraction. We explore the consequences of decentralized spatial property rights in the presence of spatial externalities. We generalize the notion of unitization-developed to enhance cooperative extraction of oil and gas fields-and apply it to renewable resources which face a similar spatial commons problem. We find that unitizing a common pool renewable resource can yield first-best outcomes even when participation is voluntary, provided profit sharing rules can vary by participant.

Decomposition of Emission Multipliers in a National Accounting Matrix Including Environmental Accounts	Journal of Industrial Ecology	2011	01	01	This study defines a linear model of emission multipliers through the use of a national accounting matrix including environmental accounts (NAMEA) for the Catalan economy that integrates the regional economic information with the greenhouse gas emissions. As in the model of income multipliers, emission multipliers can be divided into own effects, open effects, and circular effects. This decomposition shows the channels of income generation and their effects on regional greenhouse gas emissions. Our results reveal significant differences among the three gases analyzed as well as important asymmetries at a sectorial level.	Maria Llop, Laia Pi√©

Self Insurance and Insurance Demand under Self-Deception	Asia-Pacific Journal of Risk and Insurance	2011	01	01	A dynamic model of self insurance and market insurance demand against uncertain natural hazards is developed where agents incur emotional costs when the true information about potential future catastrophes becomes known. Agents purposefully ignore the incoming signals about future hazards in order to avoid finding out the true information. Faced with the emotional costs associated with true information revelation, self-deception through true information avoidance effort may be the optimal strategy to maximize current and future expected utility. Government interventions for complementing private risk mitigation and adaptation through incentives and regulations may have a varying influence on such agents exhibiting emotional costs.	Ram Ranjan
The institutional determinants of CO2 emissions: a computational modeling approach using Artificial Neural Networks and Genetic Programming	Environmetrics	2011	01	01	Understanding the complex process of climate change implies the knowledge of all possible determinants of CO2 emissions. This paper studies the influence of several institutional determinants on CO2 emissions, clarifying which variables are relevant to explain this influence. For this aim, Genetic Programming and Artificial Neural Networks are used to find an optimal functional relationship between the CO2 emissions and a set of historical, economic, geographical, religious, and social variables, which are considered as a good approximation to the institutional quality of a country. Besides this, the paper compares the results using these computational methods with that employing a more traditional parametric perspective: ordinary least squares regression (OLS). Following the empirical results of the cross-country application, this paper generates new evidence on the binomial institutions and CO2 emissions. Specifically, all methods conclude a significant influence of ethnolinguistic fractionalization (ETHF) on CO2 emissions. Copyright ¬© 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

EFFECT OF INCOME DISTRIBUTION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL KUZNETS CURVE	Pacific Economic Review	2011	01	01	This paper augments the model of Andreoni and Levinson by analyzing the effect of income distribution on the inverted U-shaped relationship between some forms of pollution and income, the so-called 'environmental Kuznets curve'. In a context in which pollution abatement technology shows increasing returns to scale and an inverse U-shaped pollution-income path is present, this study demonstrates the existence of a majority voting equilibrium, and concludes that the inverted U-shaped relationship is between median income and environmental degradation rather than between per capita income and environmental degradation. Our results suggest that an increase in equality in income distribution improves environmental quality and social efficiency. The implication of the model for the empirical estimation of environmental Kuznets curves is examined using a panel data set of 36 countries over a 20-year period. Estimation results using different models show that income distribution might be an important factor in the empirical estimation of these curves.	BAOZHI QU, YIFAN ZHANG

Ecosystem valuation: some principles and a partial application	Environmetrics	2011	01	01	Understanding the economic value of nature and the services it provides to humanity has become increasingly important for local, national and global policy, and decision-making. However, problems arise in that it is difficult to obtain meaningful values for goods and services that ecosystems provide which have no formal market, or are characteristically intangible. Additional problems occur when economic methods are applied inappropriately and when the importance of ecosystem maintenance for human welfare is underestimated. In this article, we provide clarification to practitioners on important considerations in ecosystem services valuation. We first review and adapt definitions of ecosystem services in order to make an operational link to valuation methods. We make a distinction between intermediate and final ecosystem services and also identify non-monetary ways to incorporate regulatory and support services into decision-making. We then discuss the spatially explicit nature of ecosystem service provision and benefits capture, and highlight the issues surrounding the valuing of marginal changes, nonlinearities in service benefits, and the significance of non-convexities (threshold effects). Finally, we argue for a sequential decision support system that can lead to a more integrated and rigorous approach to ecosystem valuation and illustrate some of its features in a coastal ecosystem management context.

TREND OF SUBJECTS PUBLISHED IN ECONOMICS JOURNALS 1969-2007	Economic Inquiry	2011	01	01	We describe the evolution of subject areas published in economics over four decades and calculate the percentage of articles published in each Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) subject category, with and without weighting by Eigenfactor.com's Article Influence (AI). Finance, Development, and Industrial Organization have seen their share of total articles rise over the past four decades while Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Labor have seen their share fall. We use JEL codes to define specialty journals and find that more specialty journals tend to increase the overall percentage share for that subject. This effect is ambiguous when re-weighted by AI.

The Optimal Environmental Tax and Urban Unemployment in an Open Economy	Review of Development Economics	2011	01	01	This paper investigates how a rise in the urban pollution tax rate may affect urban unemployment and welfare in a small open Harris-Todaro (HT) model with intersectoral capital mobility. First, by formulating urban pollution as a dirty input in manufacturing, we find that an increase in the urban pollution tax rate can increase the level of urban unemployment even with intersectoral capital mobility. That is, the optimistic finding by Rapanos (2007) that environmental protection policy reduces urban unemployment in the long run does not always hold. Second, the (sub)optimal pollution tax rate under urban unemployment is higher than the Pigouvian tax rate (the marginal damage of pollution). This result opposes those of Beladi and Chao (2006) for a closed HT economy and that of Tsakiris et al. (2008) for an open HT economy with sector-specific capital.	Ichiroh Daitoh, Masaya Omote
Links between Mountain Communities and Environmental Services in the Italian Alps	Sociologia Ruralis	2011	01	01	The aim of this study is to evaluate the importance of mountain communities in increasing the value of environmental services. The assumption of the research is that, for historical and cultural reasons there is a greater sense of local identity and social capital in alpine communities and thus greater attention to the environment. In these communities individuals with a higher level of social capital will have a greater tendency to play a tangible role in the preservation of the environment. The study concerns the municipality of Premana in the Italian Alps. We evaluated forest and alpine pasture environmental services using the contingent valuation (CV) method. We interviewed 319 randomly selected residents (14 per cent of the population), asking them about their willingness to pay or donate work hours. Their annual mean willingness to pay was EUR94 and EUR896 in working hours, respectively. The CV results, together with other data collected through the questionnaire, demonstrate that local traditions and social capital play a key role in the multifunctional management of forests and alpine pastures. We suggest that studies such as this one on the benefits evaluation of the environmental services of mountain resources might be used for the formation and implementation of better informed policies that will affect the future of mountain communities.

Six Distributional Effects of Environmental Policy	Risk Analysis	2011	01	01	While prior literature has identified various effects of environmental policy, this note uses the example of a proposed carbon permit system to illustrate and discuss six different types of distributional effects: (1) higher prices of carbon-intensive products, (2) changes in relative returns to factors like labor, capital, and resources, (3) allocation of scarcity rents from a restricted number of permits, (4) distribution of the benefits from improvements in environmental quality, (5) temporary effects during the transition, and (6) capitalization of all those effects into prices of land, corporate stock, or house values. The note also discusses whether all six effects could be regressive, that is, whether carbon policy could place disproportionate burden on the poor.	Don Fullerton
Behavioral Economics and the Conduct of Benefit-Cost Analysis: Towards Principles and Standards	Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis	2011	01	01	As traditionally conducted, benefit-cost analysis is rooted in neoclassical welfare economics, which, in its most simplified form, assumes that individuals act rationally and are primarily motivated by self-interest, making decisions that maximize their welfare. Its conduct is evolving to reflect recent work in behavioral economics, which explores the psychological aspects of decisionmaking. We consider several implications for analyses of social programs, focusing largely on economic valuation. First, benefit-cost analysis often involves valuing nonmarket outcomes such as reductions in health and environmental risks. Behavioral research emphasizes the need to recognize that these values are affected by psychological as well as physical attributes. Second, benefit-cost analysis traditionally uses exponential discounting to reflect time preferences, while behavioral research suggests that individuals discounting may be hyperbolic. While the appropriate rates and functional form are uncertain, market rates best represent the opportunity costs associated with diverting funds to support a particular social policy or program. Such rates reflect the intersection between technological progress and individual preferences, regardless of whether these preferences fit the standard economic model or a behavioral alternative. Third, behavioral research emphasizes the need to consider the influence of other-regarding preferences on valuation. In addition to acting altruistically, individuals may act reciprocally to reward or punish others, or use the status of others as the baseline against which to assess their own well-being. Fourth, behavioral economics identifies factors that can help researchers develop valuation studies that provide well-informed, thoughtful preferences. Finally, while behavioral research has led some to argue for a more paternalistic approach to policy analysis, an alternative is to continue to focus on describing the preferences of those affected by the policy options while working to ensure that these preferences are based on knowledge and careful reflection. Benefit-cost analysis can be best viewed as a pragmatic framework for collecting, organizing, and evaluating relevant information.	Lisa A Robinson, James K. Hammitt
Benefit-Cost Analysis with Local Residents' Stated Preference Information: A Study of Non-Motorized Transport Investments in Pune, India	Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis	2011	01	01	One of the major difficulties in doing benefit-cost analyses of a development project is to estimate a total economic value of the project benefits, which are usually multi-dimensional and include goods and services that are not traded in the market, and challenges also arise in aggregating the values of different benefits, which may not be mutually exclusive. This paper presents an analysis of a non-motorized transport project in Pune, India, which uses the contingent valuation method to estimate the total value of the project benefits across beneficiaries. A sample of the project beneficiaries are presented with a detailed description of the project and then are asked to vote on whether such a project should be undertaken given different specifications of costs to their households. A function of willingness-to-pay for the project is then derived from the survey answers and the key determinants are found to include household income, distance to the project streets, current use of the transportation modes, future use of the project streets, predicted impacts of the project, and level of trust in the government. The total willingness-to-pay of the local residents is found to be smaller than the total cost of an initial design of the project. Heteroskedasticity is also found to present in the willingness-to-pay models.	Hua Wang, Ke Fang, Yuyan Shi

Specifically, we study the conditions under which share prices are increased for the Financial Times (FT) Global 500 companies due to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a consortium of institutional investors with $57 trillion in assets. We find no systematic evidence that participation, in and of itself, increased shareholder value. However, by making use of Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, which caused the Protocol to go into effect, we find that companies' CDP participation increased shareholder value when the likelihood of climate change regulation rose. We estimate the total increase in shareholder value from CDP participation at $8.6 billion, about 86% of the size of the carbon market in 2005. Our findings suggest that institutional investor activism towards climate change can increase shareholder value when the external business environment becomes more climate conscious.

Cover Caption	Conservation Letters	2011	01	01	Cover description: The mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), used to raise funding and awareness for biodiversity in its home in central Africa, is a model example of a fl agship species. By drawing on the public appeal of species such as gorillas, tigers and pandas, conservation agencies have successfully established protected area networks, and generate funding and support for biodiversity conservation throughout the world. Although undeniably a useful strategy, this approach can sometimes fail to provide protection or adequately recover many other highly threatened species, especially those that require specialized management regimes. In a new approach developed by Liana Joseph and her colleagues, the notion of securing from extinction large numbers of species (instead of a single fl agship) is used as to raise funding and awareness for the recovery of endangered species. This approach is proposed as a complementary tool to the fl agshipspecies approach. It can be particularly useful for securing endangered species that will never be effective fl agship species and will not be adequately recovered by the actions established because of the appeal of other fl agships.

NAFTA, Environmental Kuznets Curves, and Mexico's Progress	Global Economy Journal	2011	01	01	The effects of NAFTA on Mexico s environment were of great concern pre-NAFTA and have continued to be a matter concern in the post-NAFTA era. As the many studies and evidence presented in this paper show, Mexico s environment in the post-NAFTA period has not suffered as much as pessimists feared, nor has it improved as much as optimists hoped. This outcome is consistent with theory and evidence from Environmental Kuznets Curves in that Mexico s macroeconomic performance has been inadequate to raise Mexico s per capita income to levels needed to cross estimated turning points for many pollutants. Seen in this light, Mexico s environmental quality will continue to be a mixture of modest improvements along with modest setbacks until the economy exhibits strong and sustained growth.	Jody W.

Rediscovering the Condorcet Approach as an Aggregation Technique for Progress Measures	Economic Papers: A journal of applied economics and policy	2011	01	01	There are three main aggregation techniques designed for progress measurements to help facilitate the benchmarking and ranking of countries according to aggregated dimensions. They are: (i) additive methods; (ii) geometric aggregations; and (iii) non-compensatory multi-criteria analysis. Virtually, all measures utilise one of the first two techniques. This article will critically review these aggregation approaches. In doing so, this article will assert that the Condorcet approach, despite being overlooked by many major institutions, demands strong consideration for aggregating progress measures. The theoretical implications of using the Condorcet method will be explored. An empirical application of the Condorcet model is undertaken on the Resource-Infrastructure-Environment Index to test the validity of this approach as an aggregation technique for progress measures.

Consumer Preferences for Eco, Health and Fair Trade Labels. An Application to Seafood Product in France	Journal of Agricultural & Food Industrial Organization	2012	01	01	How are consumer attitudes towards eco-labeled products affected by a profusion of labels? This article provides both theoretical and empirical insight into this issue. Assuming that consumers perceive a label both as a sign of quality and of a particular characteristic of a product, we deduce theoretical determinants for preferences for three types of label: a health label, an eco-label and a fair trade label. We enrich this analysis by synthesizing most empirical determinants of eco-labeling demand mentioned in the literature. Using a French survey on seafood products, the estimation of a rank-ordered multinomial logit with random intercepts shows a certain proximity between the profiles of pro-eco-label and pro-fair trade label consumers, whereas pro-health label individuals have a more distinct profile: The two former are more likely to be young men mainly concerned with fishing conditions, whereas the latter are older married women with children who pay attention to the product form. We relate preferences for labels to degree of altruism, environmental consciousness and other socio-economic features.	Doroth√©e Br√©card, Sterenn Lucas, Nathalie Pichot, Fr√©d√©ric Salladarr√©
The Concept of Sustainable Development and Its Impact on the Shaping of Modern International Relations through Global Agreements	Comparative Economic Research	2012	01	01	The goal of this article is a depiction of the process of the molding of the concept of sustainable development as well as a look at the influence that this concept has exerted on contemporary international politics, especially taking into account agreements of worldwide scope. This article is also an effort at demonstrating that the foundations of the concept of sustainable development can be traced to certain economic theories. The final section of this article is devoted to the characteristics of individual conferences initiated by the United Nations in order to promote enduring and sustainable development on a world scale. Also presented are the achievements of the individual conferences and their roles in demarcating universally obligatory principles and standards of sustainable development.	Anna Rydz-≈ªbikowska

The Use of Environmental Policy Instruments for Urban Wastewater Control: Evidences from an International Survey	Environmental Policy and Governance	2012	01	01	The use of environmental policy instruments as an effective approach for wastewater management has been of increasing debate. The relevant literature is mainly directed to the role of these instruments for the mitigation of air emissions, although occasionally policy implications for wastewater are noted. Empirical evidence regarding the performance of environmental instruments in wastewater management is scarce. There is thus often a discrepancy between the design and application stages of an instrument by a failure to attain the pursued targets in wastewater policy. This paper investigates the appropriateness of major applied environmental instruments and of combinatory options for wastewater pollution control. The research is based on an international survey of experienced experts and decision-makers in developed urban wastewater systems. The results suggest a strong preference for taxes and, to a lesser extent, for command-and-control approaches. The country origin of the respondents appears to be a significant factor for the preference of particular instruments. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Farmers' Willingness to Pay for a Tuberculosis Cattle Vaccine	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2012	01	01	We use contingent valuation (CV) and choice experiment (CE) methods to assess cattle farmers' attitudes to and willingness to pay (WTP) for a bovine tuberculosis (bTB) cattle vaccine, to help inform vaccine development and policy. A survey questionnaire was administered by means of telephone interviews to a stratified sample of 300 cattle farmers in annually bTB-tested areas in England and Wales. Farmers felt that bTB was a major risk for the cattle industry and that there was a high risk of their cattle getting the disease. The CE estimate produced a mean WTP of ¬£35 per animal per single dose for a vaccine that is 90% effective at reducing the risk of a bTB breakdown and an estimated ¬£55 for such a vaccine backed by 100% insurance of loss if a breakdown should occur. The CV estimate produced a mean WTP of nearly ¬£17 per dose/per animal/per year for a vaccine (including 100% insurance) which, given the average lifespan of cattle, is comparable to the CE estimate. These WTP estimates are substantially higher than the expected cost of a vaccine which suggests that farmers in high risk bTB 'hotspot' areas perceive a substantial net benefit from buying the vaccine.

Deforestation and the Environmental Kuznets Curve in Developing Countries: A Panel Smooth Transition Regression Approach	Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie	2012	01	01	Deforestation is a serious environmental problem in many developing countries. This study re-examines whether the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) relationship between deforestation and real income exists for 52 developing countries during the 1972-2003 period by applying the recently developed panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) model. This paper also considers the potential endogeneity biases and other explanatory variables as a robustness check of the EKC hypothesis. The empirical results indicate the existence of a strong threshold effect between deforestation and real income, and that evidence of the EKC hypothesis for deforestation is apparent. Along with an increase in real income, deforestation increases initially, and after reaching certain income levels, deforestation drops. The turning points are US$3,021 and US$3,103, which the PSTR model endogenously determines. La d√©forestation constitue un probl√®me environnemental pr√©occupant dans de nombreux pays en d√©veloppement. Dans le pr√©sent article, nous avons tent√© d'√©tablir s'il existe ou non une relation en U invers√© (courbe de Kuznets) entre la d√©forestation et le revenu r√©el, en appliquant la nouvelle m√©thode d'estimation d'effets de seuil avec transition lisse en panel (PSTR) √† un √©chantillon de 52 pays en d√©veloppement au cours de la p√©riode de 1972 √† 2003. Nous avons √©galement examin√© les biais endog√®nes possibles et d'autres variables explicatives pour v√©rifier la robustesse de l'hypoth√®se de Kuznets. Les r√©sultats empiriques montrent qu'il existe un effet de seuil robuste entre la d√©forestation et le revenu r√©el, et que l'√©vidence de l'hypoth√®se de Kuznets dans le cas de la d√©forestation est apparente. Lorsque le revenu r√©el augmente, la d√©forestation augmente aussi, mais lorsque le revenu atteint certains niveaux, la d√©forestation diminue. Les points de retournement sont de 3 021 $US et de 3 103 $US, ce que la m√©thode PSTR a d√©termin√© de mani√®re endog√®ne.	Yi‚ÄêBin Chiu
Economic Localization Revisited	Environmental Policy and Governance	2012	01	01	"The concept of economic localization, although receiving increasing academic and practical interest, still lacks a solid theoretical background. Our aim here is to suggest a working definition of the term economic localization and to outline its possible interpretations and operationalizations. Based on a detailed analysis of six monographs on the subject, we: (i) summarize the content of localization narratives as presented by the individual authors, capturing the variability of the localization agenda; (ii) present 11 localization dimensions and 17 more concrete aspects of localization arguments as a way to structure and operationalize the concept; and (iii) suggest a condensed working definition of the economic localization concept. We argue that it is crucial to acknowledge the complexity of the economic localization agenda, which should not simply focus only on some of its aspects without keeping a sense of the whole in mind. We thus propose to define economic localization as both the process and the result of moral, political and practical support of as many localized aspects of production and consumption as possible and desirable. Finally, we discuss the construction of ""the other"" within the localization argument, and the position of the localization concept within the research agenda of ecological economics.

The Contradictory Logic of Global Ecosystem Services Markets	Development and Change	2012	01	01	Commodification and transnational trading of ecosystem services is the most ambitious iteration yet of the strategy of 'selling nature to save it'. The World Bank and UN agencies contend that global carbon markets can slow climate change while generating resources for development. Consonant with 'inclusionary' versions of neoliberal development policy, advocates assert that international payment for ecosystem services (PES) projects, financed by carbon-offset sales and biodiversity banking, can benefit the poor. However, the World Bank also warns that a focus on poverty reduction can undermine efficiency in conservation spending. The experience of ten years of PES illustrates how, in practice, market-efficiency criteria clash directly with poverty-reduction priorities. Nevertheless, the premises of market-based PES are being extrapolated as a model for global REDD programmes financed by carbon-offset trading. This article argues that the contradiction between development and conservation observed in PES is inevitable in projects framed by the asocial logic of neoclassical economics. Application in international conservation policy of the market model, in which profit incentives depend upon differential opportunity costs, will entail a net upward redistribution of wealth from poorer to wealthier classes and from rural regions to distant centres of capital accumulation, mainly in the global North.

Why Does the Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Enhance Firm Value? The Case of Japanese Manufacturing Firms	Business Strategy and the Environment	2012	01	01	This paper examines the influence of firms' reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on firm value, measured by Tobin's q. If the stockholders/investors regard the reduction of GHG emissions as a form of intangible value, the reduction of GHG emissions will enhance firm value. To prove this relation more precisely, this paper analyzes not only the effect of the reduction of GHG emissions on firm value but also that of the market discipline imposed by the stockholders/investors in terms of the reduction of GHG emissions. Using data on 641 Japanese manufacturing firms in the period 2006-2008, the random effect instrumental variable estimate supports the view that firms with strong market discipline imposed by stockholders/investors are more likely to reduce GHG emissions and, consequently, firms that reduce more GHG emissions are more likely to enhance firm value.

Should Publicly Funded Postal Services be Reduced? A Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Universal Service Obligation in Norway	Review of Network Economics	2012	01	01	We conduct, to our knowledge, the first cost-benefit analysis of the universal service obligation (USO) in the postal sector. Three alternatives are analysed that reduce delivery frequency and/or delivery speed, with particular emphasis on quantifying the potential loss of consumer benefits. Social cost savings are analysed for the service provider, for the environment and for the government through lower levels of distortionary taxes. Although there are challenges involved in measuring the net welfare change, especially loss in consumer benefits, our results suggest that only the largest reduction in the USO may be justified on social efficiency grounds.

Role of Internalization Process in Defining the Relationship between ISO 14001 Certification and Corporate Environmental Performance	Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management	2012	01	01	The relationship between ISO 14001 certification and corporate environmental performance has become an important research topic in recent years. Based on the internalization process of ISO 14001 (the process that consolidates and embeds a firm's beliefs, attitudes, and values into its management and employees), this paper examines how internalization can impact on the corporate environmental performance. It is found that the internalization process of ISO 14001 serves an important role in mediating the relationship between ISO 14001 certification and environmental performance. The results also reveal that the internal motivation is the main driving force of internalizing ISO 14001. Copyright ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Sustainability Through Design Science: Re-Imagining Option Spaces Beyond Eco-Efficiency	Sustainable Development	2012	01	01	Ecological resource efficiency, implemented as a market mechanism within a neoclassical economy, shoulders the burden of providing a worldview for sustainable development: continuous GDP growth to provide for the expansion of human needs, and dematerialization through resource efficiency to accommodate ecological limits. However, resource efficiency does not equal resource conservation. Empirical evidence confirms that the emergent rebound effects of efficiency gains overpower their first-order intention, creating counterintuitive feedback effects at larger scales. Backfire, the collective product of individual scale resource efficiencies, is little recognized as a key driver of resource depletion. However, the acknowledgement of rebound effects as emergent properties of eco-efficiency systems also opens an opportunity space. This paper introduces the paradigm of design science for sustainable development, a qualitatively different epistemology in which the emergent effects of throughput growth and social rebound are collectively negotiated within a sustainable area budget. Multiple-alternative scenario building within this budget outlines a process within which emergent properties are negotiated relative to the resilience of social and ecological systems. Design science provides the crucial outlines for the negotiation of a common future inscribed within ecological limits. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

Environmental sustainability decision-making: clearing a path to change	Journal of Public Affairs	2012	01	01	If people expect organizations to care for the natural environment, leaders in public affairs need to better understand how and why firms move to engage in sustainable enterprise. We broach this issue as an ethical challenge and present a theoretical framework to explain the path to environmental sustainability decision-making (ESDM). Standard ethics and economic decision-making models inform our work, yet we also incorporate a non-rational element, allowing us to draw insight from psychology and organizational behavior. This view reflects the holistic nature of ESDM, an effort driven by both conscious and non-conscious elements. Our work edifies sustainable development theory by presenting ESDM in the context of collective moral emotions, which serve as underlying motivators of ideas and feelings. We add granularity to prior models, describing how this affective force can influence an organization's progression along the ESDM path. In moving to achieve sustainability goals that affect stakeholders, we explain how negative sentiments may impose drag and how positive sentiments may compel lift toward environmental sustainability action. These paths can contribute to worthwhile, yet different, forms of change. Awareness of the ESDM framework will help public affairs establish more congruent communication, processes, and policies, working to reduce uncertainty and encouraging the need for more explicit internal self-regulation. By synthesizing concepts, we create a coherent and useful picture, one that can give public affairs access to these ideas and help them find useful ways to apply them. Implications suggest leveraging strengths from affective forces may be a useful means to encourage actions that protect the natural environment. Copyright ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Leslie E.

The Value of Reducing Cancer Risks at Contaminated Sites: Are More Knowledgeable People Willing to Pay More?	Risk Analysis	2012	01	01	We use conjoint choice questions to investigate people's tastes for cancer risk reductions and income in the context of public programs that would provide for remediation at abandoned industrial contaminated sites. Our survey was self-administered using the computer by persons living in the vicinity of an important contaminated site on the Italian National Priority List. The value of a prevented case of cancer is EUR2.6 million, but this figure does vary with income, perceived exposure to contaminants, and respondent opinions about priorities that should be pursued by cleanup programs.

Sustainable Development Indicators: From Statistics to Policy	Environmental Policy and Governance	2012	01	01	Sustainable development indicators (SDIs) may have good potential to bring environmental concerns to the policy agenda. However, different understandings of sustainability, definitions of SDIs and measurement procedures may give completely different assessments of whether society moves towards a sustainable development path or not. Compilation of statistical indicators for environmental change and sustainability comprises not only a selection of facts in some technical sense, as the choices involved are conditioned by societal interests and implicit values embedded in the data-generating processes. This implies that statistical offices cannot ignore the role that values play in the generation of accurate data sets. To give an assessment of sustainability, we need not only to address historical trends but also to evaluate policy choices made today and how they may influence future development. SDI sets should be evaluated according to how they contribute to deliberation on sustainability in learning processes involving participants beyond the science-policy interface.

Behaviour of Humans and Behaviour of Models in Dynamic Space	Quaestiones Geographicae	2012	01	01	This paper addresses new trends in quantitative geography research. Modern social science research - including economic and social geography - has in the past decades shown an increasing interest in micro-oriented behaviour of actors. This is inter alia clearly reflected in spatial interaction models (SIMs), where discrete choice approaches have assumed a powerful position. This paper aims to provide in particular a concise review of micro-based research, with the aim to review the potential - but also the caveats - of micro-models to map out human behaviour. In particular, attention will be devoted to interactive learning principles that shape individual decisions. Lessons from cognitive sciences will be put forward and illustrated, amongst others on the basis of computational neural networks or spatial econometric approaches. The methodology of deductive reasoning under conditions of large data bases in studying human mobility will be questioned as well. In this context more extensive attention is given to ceteris paribus conditions and evolutionary thinking.	Peter Nijkamp

The Effect of Mandatory Agro-Environmental Policy on Farm Fertiliser and Pesticide Expenditure	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2012	01	01	EU farmers are subject to mandatory cross-compliance measures, requiring them to meet environmental conditions to be eligible for public support. These obligations reinforce incentives for farmers to change their behaviour towards the environment. We apply quasi-experimental methods to measure the causal relationship between cross-compliance and some specific farm environmental performance. We find that cross-compliance reduced farm fertiliser and pesticide expenditure. This result also holds for farmers who participated in other voluntary agro-environmental schemes. However, the results do not support our expectations that farmers who relied on larger shares of public payments had a stronger motivation to improve their environmental performance.

Restricted versus Unrestricted Choice in Labeled Choice Experiments: Exploring the Trade-Offs of Expanding Choice Dimensions	Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie	2012	01	01	"A key methodological question in choice experiments is to identify whether there is a difference in choice behavior, and subsequent value estimates, when choices are constrained to mutually exclusive alternatives in labeled experiments compared to when combinations of alternatives are available. This issue is important when policy management options are represented in labeled experiments, as it is easier to represent management options as mutually exclusive choice alternatives, but combinations of management options may be more relevant in the policy world. This issue is tested with a case study application to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. A split-sample experiment is implemented where one survey includes four labeled alternatives: a status quo option and three specific policy management options (restricted choice). The other survey provides respondents with an unrestricted choice set by including a fifth alternative choice, labeled as ""a combination of management options."" The results provide some evidence that adding a combination policy alternative does change the way that respondents view trade-offs, but that choice behavior and subsequent value estimates are consistent across the two survey formats. Une question d'ordre m√©thodologique importante se pose dans le cas de la m√©thode des choix discrets exp√©rimentaux : d√©terminer s'il existe ou non une diff√©rence dans les choix des r√©pondants et dans les estimations subs√©quentes lorsque les alternatives propos√©es sont mutuellement exclusives et lorsque les alternatives propos√©es peuvent √™tre des combinaisons d'alternatives mutuellement exclusives. Il s'agit d'un point important lorsque les options de gestion de politiques figurent dans des exp√©riences avec des alternatives nong√©n√©riques √©tant donn√© qu'il est plus facile de pr√©senter les strat√©gies de gestion comme des alternatives mutuellement exclusives, bien que les combinaisons de strat√©gies de gestion puissent √™tre plus pertinentes pour les d√©cideurs. Nous avons v√©rifi√© ce point √† l'aide d'une √©tude de cas appliqu√©e √† la grande barri√®re de corail (Great Barrier Reef) de l'Australie. Nous avons utilis√© la technique de l'√©chantillon fractionn√© : un premier sondage comprenait quatre choix distincts : conservation du statu quo et trois alternatives de gestion de politiques (choix contraint); un deuxi√®me sondage comprenait un choix complet d'alternatives incluant une cinqui√®me alternative intitul√©e ""combinaison de strat√©gies de gestion"". Les r√©sultats semblent indiquer que l'ajout d'une telle alternative influence la perception des r√©pondants √† l'√©gard de la valorisation des attributs, mais que les choix des r√©pondants et les estimations subs√©quentes se ressemblent dans les deux formules de sondage."

Green innovation in technology and innovation management - an exploratory literature review	R&D Management	2012	01	01	The importance of green innovation management is growing both in practice and in academia. This paper provides a current overview of the existing body of literature in the field of green innovations, identifying the most active scholars, institutions and relevant publications. It also contributes to a clarification of the concept 'green innovation'. The review explains that three different notions of green, eco/ecological and environmental innovation are used largely synonymously, while the notion of sustainable innovation broadens the concept and includes a social dimension. According to this review, the most active scholars are situated in Europe (especially the Netherlands, Italy and Germany). A ranking is provided of innovation management journals by their total number of green innovation publications. The paper stimulates discussion about the adequacy of research in this subject area (managing green innovation) and the dearth of comprehensive literature reviews.

Restoration and Economics: A Union Waiting to Happen?	Restoration Ecology	2012	01	01	In this article, our objective is to introduce economics as a tool for the planning, prioritization, and evaluation of restoration projects. Studies that develop economic estimates of public values for ecological restoration employ methods that may be unfamiliar to practitioners. We hope to address this knowledge gap by describing economic concepts in the context of ecological restoration. We have summarized the most common methods for estimating the costs and benefits of restoration projects as well as frameworks for decision analysis and prioritization. These methods are illustrated in a review of the literature as it applies to terrestrial restoration in the United States, with examples of applications of methods to projects. Our hope is that practitioners will consider collaborating with economists to help ensure that restoration costs and benefits are identified and understood.	Alicia S. T. Robbins, Jean M. Daniels

PARTICIPATION OF FIRMS IN VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION PROGRAMS: AN ANALYSIS OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND CAPITAL MARKET PERFORMANCE	Contemporary Economic Policy	2012	01	01	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employs voluntary programs as a policy instrument to encourage firms to go beyond mere compliance with laws and regulations in protecting the environment. Based on event study methodology, this paper tests for abnormal stock market returns from membership in the National Environmental Performance Track (NEPT) program. The analysis shows that there is strong evidence that acceptance of a facility to the NEPT adds significantly to the market capitalization of the accepted firms. Corporate social responsibility can be financially rewarding for firms and voluntary programs of the EPA can be an effective complement to performance-based regulatory instruments.

Integrating Ecology and Economics for Restoration: Using Ecological Indicators in Valuation of Ecosystem Services	Restoration Ecology	2012	01	01	Because it can uniquely furnish insights into nonuse values for ecosystem services, survey-based Stated Preference (SP) valuation is widely used to estimate the benefits of ecological restoration. SP surveys ask respondents to select among restoration options yielding different ecological outcomes. This review examines the representation of ecological outcomes in SP studies seeking to quantify values for restoration of aquatic ecosystems. To promote the validity of ecological indicators used in SP valuation, we identified four standards: indicators should be measurable, interpretable, applicable, and comprehensive. We reviewed recent SP studies estimating the value of aquatic ecosystem services to assess whether ecological indicators in current use had these desirable properties. More than half of the 54 indicators reviewed were measurable, meaning referable to potentially precise quantification. About one-third were interpretable, that is, presented in a way that facilitates understanding the effects of restoration. About three quarters of the indicators were applicable; SP valuation practitioners typically consult with natural scientists to ensure that indicators represent the effect of stressors on ecological systems and with focus groups to ensure that indicators have a connection with ecosystem services that contribute to public well-being. While most of the SP studies employed diverse and potentially comprehensive indicators that could capture direct and indirect effects of restoration, and 6 of 20 studies used indicators that met all standards, shortcomings in the indicators were common. These problems can be rectified with attention to how natural scientists measure change and to relationships between restoration outcomes and characteristics of fully restored reference ecosystems.

International Capital Mobility and Free Trade Once Again	Review of International Economics	2012	01	01	Using a Heckscher-Ohlin model, this paper re-examines Robert Mundell's famous thesis that free trade and unimpeded capital mobility are perfect substitutes. Under very general conditions which, according to many economists, have caused international convergence of factor rewards, we show that in a polluted environment free trade is inferior to free international investment. This happens even though commodity prices and factor rewards are the same with both policies. The practical side of our thesis is that the world will be better off by reducing the volume of trade while removing all barriers to foreign direct investment that at present hamper the service industries.

Integrative Frontiers in Environmental Policy Theory and Research	Policy Studies Journal	2012	01	01	"Environmental policy research continues to advance toward a more Kuhnian ""normal"" science where theory and empirical tools are brought to bear on real-world policy systems to better understand social processes and determine the context in which policies work best. Traditional environmental policy tools now involve more flexible market-based instruments, voluntary agreements, and information provision tools like ecolabels and sustainability indicators. Policy process theories continue to be refined through hypothesis testing and are evolving into more integrative and multidisciplinary frameworks. Interdisciplinary methods are also being employed to better measure and analyze environmental outcomes, which has always been a major challenge in environmental policy research. These research tools are being explored in emerging policy approaches like collaborative partnerships and with novel environmental issues like climate change adaptation, pharmaceuticals and personal care products, and nanotechnology."

ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETS: WHAT DO WE LEARN FROM THE LAB?	Journal of Economic Surveys	2013	01	01	In recent years, some of the most influential policies have been either tested or evaluated using experimental methods. Experiments have provided significant insights on the implications of different designs on market outcomes and the lessons learned have helped improve academic debate and the interaction between policy makers and researchers. In this paper, we provide an overview of experiments relating to environmental markets. Expenditure on environmental programs has been growing in importance yet it is controversial in current times due to the fiscal cuts around the world. Finding cost-effective ways of reaching environmental goals is thus an objective of most governments. Research using experiments can help isolate how individuals and regulators would respond to incentives and therefore identify the most effective programs.	Lana Friesen, Lata Gangadharan
DELIBERATIVE MONETARY VALUATION: IN SEARCH OF A DEMOCRATIC AND VALUE PLURAL APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY	Journal of Economic Surveys	2013	01	01	"The use of deliberative methods to assess environmental values in monetary terms has been motivated by the potential for small group discussion to help with preference formation and the inclusion of non-economic values. In this review, two broad approaches are identified: preference economisation and preference moralisation. The former is analytical, concentrates upon issues of poor respondent cognition and produces a narrow conception of value linked to utilitarianism. The latter emphasises political legitimacy, appeals to community values and tends to privilege arguments made in the public interest. Both approaches are shown to embrace forms of value convergence, which undermine the prospects for value pluralism. As a result exclusion and predefinition of values dominates current practice. In order to maintain democratic credentials, the importance attributed to monetary value needs to be left as an open question to be addressed as part of a process determining an ""agreement to pay"". To this end we identify a discourse-based approach as a third way consistent with the democratic and value plural potential of deliberative monetary valuation."	Alex Y. Lo, Clive L. Spash
Stakeholders' Influences on Corporate Green Innovation Strategy: A Case Study of Manufacturing Firms in China	Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management	2013	01	01	Facing the challenge of environmental degradation in China, a growing number of firms have begun to integrate environmental management systems into their business strategies and develop green innovation strategies. Based on the stakeholder theory, this paper attempts to explore the influences of stakeholders on the implementation of green process and green product innovation. Empirical results show that foreign customers play a significant role in driving companies to adopt strategy of green process and green product innovation. For foreign-invested enterprises, the effect is limited to the adoption of green process innovation. It further reveals that community stakeholders and regulatory stakeholders have no significant effect on the corporate green process and green product innovation.

VARIATIONS IN ECOSYSTEM SERVICE VALUES AND LOCAL ECONOMY IN RESPONSE TO LAND USE: A CASE STUDY OF WU'AN, CHINA	Land Degradation & Development	2013	01	01	In an industrial/mining city, land use, ecosystem service values (ESVs) and local economy have a close relation. The study reported in this paper is conducive to optimising land use and to balancing ecosystem services and local economy. The aim is to provide useful information and advice for industrial/mining cities concerned with sustainable development. Wu'an, which is rich in mineral resources and an important energy supplier in Hebei Province, is selected as the study area. The ecosystem service value coefficients of industrial ecosystem and urban ecosystem are estimated adopting the cost method and applied to the city from 1996 to 2005. The temporal and spatial changes of the ESVs estimated within the entire ecosystem, sub-ecosystems and individual ecosystem services are analysed and discussed based on land use. The results show that land use in Wu'an had a great influence on the ESVs and especially the project of converting farmland into forests determined the entire ecosystem structure and functions. Additionally, the study shows the comparing relationships between ecosystem service values and local economy through various mathematical expressions. One significant relationship can be abstracted into an inverse curve (zone) under restrained conditions. The conclusions suggest that the rapid local economy development should build on a reasonable land use with emphasis on the high ecosystem services. Copyright ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	J. J.

Environmental standards and labor productivity: Understanding the mechanisms that sustain sustainability	Journal of Organizational Behavior	2013	01	01	In the last decade, a rising number of firms have adopted voluntary international environmental management and product standards, such as the international ISO 14001 management standard or organic certification. Although emerging research analyzes the impact of these standards on environmental and financial performance, there is to our knowledge no empirical research on how they affect the productivity of employees. In this paper, we investigate the direct relationship between environmental standards and labor productivity, as well as two mediating mechanisms through which environmental standards influence labor productivity: employee training and enhanced interpersonal contacts within the firm. Our empirical results, based on a French employer-employee survey from 5220 firms, reveal that firms that have adopted environmental standards enjoy a one standard deviation higher labor productivity than firms that have not adopted such standards.

THE IMPACT OF TRADE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH ON THE ENVIRONMENT: REVISITING THE CROSS-COUNTRY EVIDENCE	Journal of International Development	2013	01	01	This paper explores the inter-relations between economic growth, international trade and environmental degradation empirically by using panel data. Previous critique, especially on the econometric specification, is embedded. Several environmental factors and one sustainability indicator are analysed. The results indicate that there is an environmental Kuznets curve for most pollutants, but with several reservations. None of the various hypotheses that concern the link between trade and environmental degradation can be entirely confirmed. There is modest support for the pollution haven hypothesis. In addition, trade liberalisation might be beneficial to sustainable development for rich countries but harmful to poor ones. Copyright ¬© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	Linda Kleemann, Awudu Abdulai
When Heterodoxy Becomes Orthodoxy: Ecological Economics in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics	American Journal of Economics and Sociology	2013	01	01	"Modern ecological economics emerged in opposition to mainstream economics as a scientific approach with many key heterodox features. Among these are an open systems perspective, transdisciplinarity, and radical criticism of the conventional representation of economic process. The term ""ecological economics"" was included internationally in the second edition (2008) of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, the most prestigious and widely used dictionary of economics. In our view, however, the entry does little to facilitate understanding of the heterodox features, and theoretical and methodological controversies that have developed in ecological economics over the last two decades."	√ìscar Carpintero
Improving the Policy Mix: The Scope for Market-Based Instruments in EU Biodiversity Policy	Environmental Policy and Governance	2013	01	01	The European Union (EU) is still lagging behind its objective to halt the loss of biodiversity. Current research shows promising ways to improve the cost-effectiveness of existing policy mixes for habitat protection through the introduction of market-based instruments. To harness the potential of these ideas for the pursuit of the EU's biodiversity conservation objective during upcoming changes in the policy landscape and to identify the optimal allocation for each instrument, it is necessary to understand the scope for the introduction of market-based instruments across all relevant fields of EU policymaking. So far, there are, however, few systematic analyses satisfying this purpose. This article analyzes existing instruments under the Birds and the Habitats Directives and the Common Agricultural Policy, and the de lege and de facto constraints and opportunities that result from these policies for the introduction of additional market-based instruments. The analysis shows that the distribution of authority between the EU and its member states gives each of them different comparative advantages for the introduction of market-based instruments in the different policy fields. These provide various opportunities for the improvement of the existing policy mix for habitat protection.

Do Voluntary Programs Reduce Pollution? Examining ISO 14001's Effectiveness across Countries	Policy Studies Journal	2013	01	01	Voluntary environmental programs have emerged as important instruments of environmental policy. Despite considerable scholarly scrutiny, there remain debates about whether they reduce pollution among participants, and their overall impact at the country level. We present a cross-national analysis of the efficacy of ISO 14001, the most widely adopted voluntary environmental program in the world. While several single country studies have explored the effect of ISO 14001 participation on pollution reduction at the facility level, this is the first article to assess (i) national level pollution reduction effects of ISO 14001 participation levels, (ii) across a large number of countries, and (iii) across two pollutants. We examine whether all else equal, the national level uptakes of ISO 14001 are associated with reductions in air emissions (sulfur dioxide, SO2) and water pollution (biochemical oxygen demand, BOD). Because firms, regulators, and environmental groups tend to focus more on visible types of pollution than less visible ones, we hypothesize that ISO 14001 uptake will be associated with more pronounced reductions in air pollution (visible) in relation to water pollution (less visible). Our analyses of pollution levels for a panel of 138 (72 for BOD) countries for the 1991-2005 period suggest that a 1 percent increase in aggregate levels of ISO 14001 adoption is associated with about a 0.064 percent reduction in SO2 emissions, all else equal. In contrast, we do not find a statistically significant relationship between ISO 14001 adoption levels and changes in water pollution (BOD).	Matthew Potoski, Aseem Prakash
CO2 Emissions and Financial Performance of Socially Responsible Firms: An Empirical Survey	Business Strategy and the Environment	2013	01	01	A firm's financial performance is closely related to its environmental behavior. This result is valid especially in the case of socially responsible firms. In the present study a data econometric analysis is conducted based on a GARCH model for socially responsible and conventional firms. According to our findings, the performance of socially responsible firms is negatively related to an increase of global CO2 emissions. The firms' costs for implementing environmental policies and the investors' attitude towards the aforementioned firms may account for our results.

The environmental Kuznets curve: functional form, time-varying heterogeneity and outliers in a panel setting	Environmetrics	2013	01	01	This paper contributes to extend the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) literature by introducing a new estimation technique able to deal with the issue of slope heterogeneity, functional form issues, the role of unobserved time-dependent factors and the presence of outliers in the data. A robust hidden Markov model is used to estimate an Environmental Kuznets Curve for a sample of 28 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development countries over the period 1968 to 2006. Dependent mixture models provide more flexibility than single-distributions do by assuming the existence of a latent process that follows a finite state first-order Markov chain and affects the distribution of the response variable. The main results indicate that the relationship between emissions and income is country-specific and changes over time. By using robust estimation, five homogeneous groups of countries are identified and country-membership transition dynamics are shown. Copyright ¬© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Led on the Wrong Track? A Note on the Direction of Technical Change under Environmental Liability Law	Journal of Public Economic Theory	2013	01	01	This note shows that polluters might opt for technical change which is inferior to other innovations from a social standpoint under environmental liability law. Polluters choose what is socially optimal under strict liability. However, we show that it is possible to have not only too little or too much technical change of a given kind but, importantly, also the wrong kind of technical change under negligence.

US Ethanol Trade Policy: Pollution Reduction or Domestic Protection	Review of International Economics	2013	01	01	To mitigate dependence on fossil fuel and reduce pollution, the US government has undertaken several policies-an import tariff, tax credit, and mandate-to augment domestic ethanol production and increase ethanol in the fuel supply. This study uses a general equilibrium model to analyze the effects of the US ethanol import tariff on welfare by internalizing the externality and incorporating US fuel and ethanol policies and to determine the optimal tariff. The results show that because of the environmental benefits of imported ethanol, the adverse effects of domestic ethanol on the environment, the need for the imported ethanol to boost the blended gasoline production, and the economy-wide interactions of various markets, the optimal trade policy may call for subsidizing rather than taxing ethanol imports.

The determinants of innovation in green supply chains: evidence from an Italian sectoral study	R&D Management	2013	01	01	Innovation processes are increasingly spreading through the unbounded universe of European small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It represents a fundamental opportunity especially for those SMEs operating in the so-called 'green economy' sectors, in order to be competitive in a National, European and International market with their sustainable products and services. Drawing upon a database of over 300 enterprises operating within the eight defined green sectors, this paper assesses the determinants and drawbacks of innovation. In particular, by using an econometrical approach, we tested the following propositions: (1) small dimension of enterprises is not an obstacle to their innovation capabilities; (2) the adoption of an internationalisation strategy is an opportunity and a stimulus to innovation for SMEs; (3) cooperation with research centres, financial partners, trade association and public entities can help SMEs to overcome difficulties and help them to develop and offer innovative products and services, so to be competitive at an international level. The econometric analysis shows a positive impact of the variables 'dimension' and 'level of internationalisation' on innovation capabilities. In addition, cooperation with research centres and access to capital market are positively related with effective innovations.	Marco Frey, Fabio Iraldo, Francesco Testa
Compensating white-tailed eagle mortality at the Sm√∏la wind-power plant using electrocution prevention measures	Wildlife Society Bulletin	2013	01	01	Environmental impact assessment allows for compensation of environmental injuries in the form of resource-based restoration projects. Given that compensation is a desired policy at a given site, this study suggests an interdisciplinary scaling method (Resource Equivalency Analysis) that relies on a non-monetary bird-year metric to quantify and value the impact on human welfare from ecosystem service loss. The lost value associated with white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) turbine collisions at the Sm√∏la wind-power plant (debit) in central Norway is compensated through white-tailed eagle electrocution-prevention measures at nearby power lines (credit), scaled using the same bird-year metric. We found that 172 actual and projected white-tailed eagle turbine collisions (2005-2027) led to a debit of 3,454 discounted bird-years, which captures lost life expectancy discounted to present value. Field searches indicated that annual white-tailed eagle electrocution mortality per electric distribution pole (or pylon) at Sm√∏la ranges from 0.002 to 0.014 (2009-2011). We suggest that retrofitting between 348 and 2,209 pylons at a present-value cost of US$1.2-7.9 million (2011 at 3%) will provide equivalent value and thus compensate the public for their welfare losses. Improved electrocution probability models will improve cost-effectiveness of retrofitting as a compensatory measure. Although Resource Equivalency Analysis may provide an approach for scaling a biodiversity offset, it cannot address the inevitable environmental trade-offs required in assessing the social profitability of choosing to compensate at a particular site. ¬© 2013 The Wildlife Society.

The Design of Markets for Soil Carbon Sequestration	Economic Papers: A journal of applied economics and policy	2013	01	01	There is great potential for soil carbon sequestration to contribute to climate change mitigation. However, there are a number of difficulties in measuring and verifying soil carbon sequestration for market-based policies for soil carbon sequestration. In particular, measurement costs and other transaction costs will ultimately determine the practicality of any policy. The relationship between soil carbon spatial heterogeneity, measurement precision and measurement costs is central to the design of contracts for soil carbon sequestration. Importantly, these factors determine the practicality of policy alternatives and the efficiency of alternative contract designs. The details of contract design change the incentives faced by landholders as well as the allocation of risk between sellers and buyers. For example, some contract designs link payments to alternative land management practices whereas others link payments to directly measured outcomes. Research in soil science provides the knowledge necessary to link land use and management to sequestration and the measurement approaches required to verify sequestration. Careful consideration of these factors in market design is needed to determine whether potential benefits outweigh the costs of implementing any policy intended to promote soil carbon sequestration.

Regulation-by-information in areas of limited statehood: Lessons from the Philippines' environmental regulation	Regulation & Governance	2013	01	01	This research examines conditions under which environmental regulatory disclosure is more versus less likely to work, with focus on the case of the Philippines. Two major findings arise out of a case study. First, we observe a mismatch between the nature of information and the main addressees of the disclosed information, which led the operation of the subject disclosure program to deviate from its targets. Second, this institutional deficiency has to do with the organizational culture and routine practice of the implementing agency. The second finding challenges a major justification of information-based environmental regulation (IBER) administered in weak states and underscores the role that administrative capacity plays in making novel regulations come into effect. Contrary to the popular belief that IBER creates non-governmental forces that offset a limited statehood, it may be less likely to work where state administrative capacity is weak.

Do Farmers Internalise Environmental Spillovers of Pesticides in Production?	Journal of Agricultural Economics	2013	01	01	Pesticides are used in agriculture to protect crops from pests and diseases, with indiscriminate pesticide use having several adverse effects on the environment and human health. An important question is whether the environmental spillovers of pesticides also affect the farmers' production environment. We use a model of optimal pesticide use that explicitly incorporates the symmetric and asymmetric effect of pesticides' environmental spillovers on crop production. The application focuses on panel data from Dutch cash crop producers. We show that pesticides have a positive direct impact on output and a negative indirect impact through their effects on the production environment.	Theodoros Skevas, Spiro E.

Is environmental sustainability influenced by socioeconomic and sociopolitical factors? cross-country empirical evidence	Sustainable Development	2013	01	01	The current study attempts to understand the relationships among Environmental Quality (EQ), Human Development (HD) and political and governance regimes in a cross-country framework through secondary data analysis. The underlying hypothesis is that in addition to income, as reflected from the literature on the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, several other factors, including socioeconomic (e.g. human development and corruption) and sociopolitical (e.g. ability to exercise democratic rights) factors, may influence environmental policy-making, and thereby environmental sustainability, in a country. The EQ (i.e. environmental sustainability) of the countries in the current study is denoted by their Environmental Performance Index (2008). Human development is represented by Human Development Index (2007). Democracy Index (2008) and Corruption Perceptions Index (2008) are considered as proxies for political transparency in a country and its susceptibility to rent-seeking activities, respectively. The cross-country empirical findings confirm the closer association between the socioeconomic and sociopolitical factors and sustainable development.

A Knowledge-Based View of the Porter Hypothesis	Environmental Policy and Governance	2013	01	01	It is commonly held that environmental regulation affects competitiveness negatively. The Porter Hypothesis contests this view by proposing a dynamic perspective in which innovations induced by apt environmental policies may offset regulation costs. The existing theoretical evidence largely suggests that the classic perception of a trade-off between economic and ecological goals prevails. Some empirical evidence, however, supports the Porter Hypothesis. With the aim to shed more light on these ambiguities this paper argues that the Porter Hypothesis lacks a comprehensive microeconomic foundation as it does not consider the properties and ramifications of knowledge capital. To address this shortcoming the paper develops a novel knowledge-based view of the hypothesis that introduces cumulative knowledge capital as the most important asset in attaining a sustainable competitive advantage in the sense of the resource-based view of the firm. Based on the basic properties of knowledge the new perspective, which is applicable to both incremental and radical innovations, highlights the development and accumulation processes of superior knowledge capital and further discusses the barriers to its growth. In combination with the exogenous pressure of environmental regulation these insights are finally compiled into a knowledge-based view of the Porter Hypothesis.

Viability of Transboundary Fisheries and International Quota Allocation: The Case of the Bay of Biscay Anchovy	Canadian Journal of Agricultural Economics/Revue canadienne d'agroeconomie	2013	01	01	This paper examines the viability of the management of a transboundary fishery. In a deterministic dynamic framework, we consider a fish stock with two age groups, juveniles and adults, exploited by two countries having a different impact on the age groups. A regulatory agency defines an annual total allowable catch and its allocation between the two countries. We consider allocations satisfying a set of constraints representing viability conditions. The constraints include a minimal quota and minimal profit for each country. We compare intertemporal viable trajectories with the trajectory resulting from a cooperative game in which the two countries agree on the maximization of the fishery's total profit. While the cooperative solution consists in allocating the whole fishing effort to the most efficient country, the viable solution ensures a limitation of inequalities but reduces the overall economic outcome. The results are illustrated for the Bay of Biscay anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus L.), exploited by Spain and France, with two different types of gear, the purse seine for Spain and the pelagic trawl for France.

Motivations and Barriers to Corporate Environmental Management	Business Strategy and the Environment	2013	01	01	This paper integrates two conceptual frameworks, utility maximization and institutional theory, to analyze voluntary corporate environmental management. The utility maximization or economic approach centers on motivations to decrease cost, increase revenue and improve manager utility. Institutional theory emphasizes how external pressures from market and non-market constituents shape the firm's environmental efforts. We view the two frameworks as complementary and postulate a model that includes both types of influences. Survey data from six major industries consisting of a diverse set of facilities are used to estimate the effects of economic and institutional factors on a facility's use of environmental practices and pollution-prevention activities. Our results support the hypothesized model, and show that cost barriers, management attitudes toward environmental stewardship, company ownership and external institutional forces, including competitiveness, investor and regulatory pressures, all affect a facility's environmental practices and pollution prevention activities. Findings suggest that a multifaceted policy strategy is needed to advance corporate environmental management across diverse firms.

Population Growth and Natural-Resource Scarcity: Long-Run Development under Seemingly Unfavorable Conditions	The Scandinavian Journal of Economics	2013	01	01	In this paper, I consider an economy that is constrained by the use of natural resources and driven by knowledge accumulation. Resources are essential inputs in all sectors. I show that population growth and poor input substitution are not detrimental but, on the contrary, are even necessary to obtain a sustainable consumption level. I find a general rule to define the conditions for a constant innovation rate. The rule does not apply to capital but to labor growth, which is the crucial input in research. Furthermore, the rule relates to the sectoral structure of the economy, and to demographic transition. The results continue to hold with a backstop technology, and are extended for the case of minimum resource constraints.	Lucas Bretschger
Stock Market Reactions to Environmental News in the Food Industry	Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics	2014	01	01	Few studies to date have addressed the relationship between the food industry's environmental and financial performances although the industry is one of the biggest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions. We analyze the impact of environmental news about selected food companies on their stock prices. Results show that positive (negative) events that are the result of direct internal company actions lead to higher (lower) predicted returns, whereas events related to third-party opinions lead to smaller changes in predicted returns in short event windows. This study highlights the importance of conducting the analysis on a disaggregated basis by incorporating firm-level variables.	Zsuzsanna De√°k, Berna Karali
